lowing herd wind slowly o'er the lea,\nThe plowman homeward plods his weary way,\nAnd leaves the world to darkness and to me.\n\nNow fades the glimm'ring landscape on the sight,\nAnd all the air a solemn stillness holds,\nSave where the beetle wheels his droning flight,\nAnd drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds;\n\nSave that from yonder ivy-mantled tow'r\nThe moping owl does to the moon complain\nOf such, as wand'ring near her secret bow'r,\nMolest her ancient solitary reign.\n\nBeneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree's shade,\nWhere heaves the turf in many a mould'ring heap,\nEach in his narrow cell for ever laid,\nThe rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep.\n\nThe breezy call of incense-breathing Morn,\nThe swallow twitt'ring from the straw-built shed,\nThe cock's shrill clarion, or the echoing horn,\nNo more shall rouse them from their lowly bed.\n\nFor them no more the blazing hearth shall burn,\nOr busy housewife ply her evening care:\nNo children run to lisp their sire's return,\nOr climb his knees the envied kiss to share.\n\nOft did the harvest to their sickle yield,\nTheir furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke;\nHow jocund did they drive their team afield!\nHow bow'd the woods beneath their sturdy stroke!\n\nLet not Ambition mock their useful toil,\nTheir homely joys, and destiny obscure;\nNor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile\nThe short and simple annals of the poor.\n\nThe boast of heraldry, the pomp of pow'r,\nAnd all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave,\nAwaits alike th' inevitable hour.\n\nThe paths of glory lead but to the grave.\n\nNor you, ye proud, impute to these the fault,\nIf Mem'ry o'er their tomb no trophies raise,\nWhere thro' the long-drawn aisle and fretted vault\nThe pealing anthem swells the note of praise.\n\nCan storied urn or animated bust\nBack to its mansion call the fleeting breath?\n\nCan Honour's voice provoke the silent dust,\nOr Flatt'ry soothe the dull cold ear of Death?\n\nPerhaps in this neglected spot is laid\nSome heart once pregnant with celestial fire;\nHands, that the rod of empire might have sway'd,\nOr wak'd to ecstasy the living lyre.\n\nBut Knowledge to their eyes her ample page\nRich with the spoils of time did ne'er unroll;\nChill Penury repress'd their noble rage,\nAnd froze the genial current of the soul.\n\nFull many a gem of purest ray serene,\nThe dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear:\nFull many a flow'r is born to blush unseen,\nAnd waste its sweetness on the desert air.\n\nSome village-Hampden, that with dauntless breast\nThe little tyrant of his fields withstood;\nSome mute inglorious Milton here may rest,\nSome Cromwell guiltless of his country's blood.\n\nTh' applause of list'ning senates to command,\nThe threats of pain and ruin to despise,\nTo scatter plenty o'er a smiling land,\nAnd read their hist'ry in a nation's eyes,\n\nTheir lot forbade: nor circumscrib'd alone\nTheir growing virtues, but their crimes confin'd;\nForbade to wade through slaughter to a throne,\nAnd shut the gates of mercy on mankind,\n\nThe struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide,\nTo quench the blushes of ingenuous shame,\nOr heap the shrine of Luxury and Pride\nWith incense kindled at the Muse's flame.\n\nFar from the madding crowd's ignoble strife,\nTheir sober wishes never learn'd to stray;\nAlong the cool sequester'd vale of life\nThey kept the noiseless tenor of their way.\n\nYet ev'n these bones from insult to protect,\nSome frail memorial still erected nigh,\nWith uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd,\nImplores the passing tribute of a sigh.\n\nTheir name, their years, spelt by th' unletter'd muse,\nThe place of fame and elegy supply:\nAnd many a holy text around she strews,\nThat teach the rustic moralist to die.\n\nFor who to dumb Forgetfulness a prey,\nThis pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd,\nLeft the warm precincts of the cheerful day,\nNor cast one longing, ling'ring look behind?\n\nOn some fond breast the parting soul relies,\nSome pious drops the closing eye requires;\nEv'n from the tomb the voice of Nature cries,\nEv'n in our ashes live their wonted fires.\n\nFor thee, who mindful of th' unhonour'd Dead\nDost in these lines their artless tale relate;\nIf chance, by lonely contemplation led,\nSome kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate,\n\nHaply some hoary-headed swain may say,\n\"Oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn\nBrushing with hasty steps the dews away\nTo meet the sun upon the upland lawn.\n\n\"There at the foot of yonder nodding beech\nThat wreathes its old fantastic roots so high,\nHis listless length at noontide would he stretch,\nAnd pore upon the brook that babbles by.\n\n\"Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn,\nMutt'ring his wayward fancies he would rove,\nNow drooping, woeful wan, like one forlorn,\nOr craz'd with care, or cross'd in hopeless love.\n\n\"One morn I miss'd him on the custom'd hill,\nAlong the heath and near his fav'rite tree;\nAnother came; nor yet beside the rill,\nNor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he;\n\n\"The next with dirges due in sad array\nSlow thro' the church-way path we saw him borne.\n\nApproach and read (for thou canst read) the lay,\nGrav'd on the stone beneath yon aged thorn.\n\n\nTHE EPITAPH\nHere rests his head upon the lap of Earth\nA youth to Fortune and to Fame unknown.\n\nFair Science frown'd not on his humble birth,\nAnd Melancholy mark'd him for her own.\n\nLarge was his bounty, and his soul sincere,\nHeav'n did a recompense as largely send:\nHe gave to Mis'ry all he had, a tear,\nHe gain'd from Heav'n ('twas all he wish'd) a friend.\n\nNo farther seek his merits to disclose,\nOr draw his frailties from their dread abode,\n(There they alike in trembling hope repose)\nThe

and again I hear\nThese waters, rolling from their mountain-springs\nWith a soft inland murmur.\n\n\u2014Once again\nDo I behold these steep and lofty cliffs,\nThat on a wild secluded scene impress\nThoughts of more deep seclusion; and connect\nThe landscape with the quiet of the sky.\n\nThe day is come when I again repose\nHere, under this dark sycamore, and view\nThese plots of cottage-ground, these orchard-tufts,\nWhich at this season, with their unripe fruits,\nAre clad in one green hue, and lose themselves\n'Mid groves and copses.\n\nOnce again I see\nThese hedge-rows, hardly hedge-rows, little lines\nOf sportive wood run wild: these pastoral farms,\nGreen to the very door; and wreaths of smoke\nSent up, in silence, from among the trees!\nWith some uncertain notice, as might seem\nOf vagrant dwellers in the houseless woods,\nOr of some Hermit's cave, where by his fire\nThe Hermit sits alone.\n\nThese beauteous forms,\nThrough a long absence, have not been to me\nAs is a landscape to a blind man's eye:\nBut oft, in lonely rooms, and 'mid the din\nOf towns and cities, I have owed to them\nIn hours of weariness, sensations sweet,\nFelt in the blood, and felt along the heart;\nAnd passing even into my purer mind,\nWith tranquil restoration:\u2014feelings too\nOf unremembered pleasure: such, perhaps,\nAs have no slight or trivial influence\nOn that best portion of a good man's life,\nHis little, nameless, unremembered, acts\nOf kindness and of love.\n\nNor less, I trust,\nTo them I may have owed another gift,\nOf aspect more sublime; that blessed mood,\nIn which the burthen of the mystery,\nIn which the heavy and the weary weight\nOf all this unintelligible world,\nIs lightened:\u2014that serene and blessed mood,\nIn which the affections gently lead us on,\u2014\nUntil, the breath of this corporeal frame\nAnd even the motion of our human blood\nAlmost suspended, we are laid asleep\nIn body, and become a living soul:\nWhile with an eye made quiet by the power\nOf harmony, and the deep power of joy,\nWe see into the life of things.\n\nIf this\nBe but a vain belief, yet, oh! how oft\u2014\nIn darkness and amid the many shapes\nOf joyless daylight; when the fretful stir\nUnprofitable, and the fever of the world,\nHave hung upon the beatings of my heart\u2014\nHow oft, in spirit, have I turned to thee,\nO sylvan Wye! thou wanderer thro' the woods,\nHow often has my spirit turned to thee!\nAnd now, with gleams of half-extinguished thought,\nWith many recognitions dim and faint,\nAnd somewhat of a sad perplexity,\nThe picture of the mind revives again:\nWhile here I stand, not only with the sense\nOf present pleasure, but with pleasing thoughts\nThat in this moment there is life and food\nFor future years.\n\nAnd so I dare to hope,\nThough changed, no doubt, from what I was when first\nI came among these hills; when like a roe\nI bounded o'er the mountains, by the sides\nOf the deep rivers, and the lonely streams,\nWherever nature led: more like a man\nFlying from something that he dreads, than one\nWho sought the thing he loved.\n\nFor nature then\n(The coarser pleasures of my boyish days,\nAnd their glad animal movements all gone by)\nTo me was all in all.\n\n\u2014I cannot paint\nWhat then I was.\n\nThe sounding cataract\nHaunted me like a passion: the tall rock,\nThe mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,\nTheir colours and their forms, were then to me\nAn appetite; a feeling and a love,\nThat had no need of a remoter charm,\nBy thought supplied, nor any interest\nUnborrowed from the eye.\n\n\u2014That time is past,\nAnd all its aching joys are now no more,\nAnd all its dizzy raptures.\n\nNot for this\nFaint I, nor mourn nor murmur, other gifts\nHave followed; for such loss, I would believe,\nAbundant recompence.\n\nFor I have learned\nTo look on nature, not as in the hour\nOf thoughtless youth; but hearing oftentimes\nThe still, sad music of humanity,\nNor harsh nor grating, though of ample power\nTo chasten and subdue.\n\nAnd I have felt\nA presence that disturbs me with the joy\nOf elevated thoughts; a sense sublime\nOf something far more deeply interfused,\nWhose dwelling is the light of setting suns,\nAnd the round ocean and the living air,\nAnd the blue sky, and in the mind of man;\nA motion and a spirit, that impels\nAll thinking things, all objects of all thought,\nAnd rolls through all things.\n\nTherefore am I still\nA lover of the meadows and the woods,\nAnd mountains; and of all that we behold\nFrom this green earth; of all the mighty world\nOf eye, and ear,\u2014both what they half create,\nAnd what perceive; well pleased to recognise\nIn nature and the language of the sense,\nThe anchor of my purest thoughts, the nurse,\nThe guide, the guardian of my heart, and soul\nOf all my moral being.\n\nNor perchance,\nIf I were not thus taught, should I the more\nSuffer my genial spirits to decay:\nFor thou art with me here upon the banks\nOf this fair river; thou my dearest Friend,\nMy dear, dear Friend; and in thy voice I catch\nThe language of my former heart, and read\nMy former pleasures in the shooting lights\nOf thy wild eyes.\n\nOh! yet a little while\nMay I behold in thee what I was once,\nMy dear, dear Sister! and this prayer I make,\nKnowing that Nature never did betray\nThe heart that loved her; 'tis her privilege,\nThrough all the years of this our life, to lead\nFrom joy to joy: for she can so inform\nThe mind that is within us, so impress\nWith quietness and beauty, and so feed\nWith lofty thoughts, that neither evil tongues,\nRash judgments, nor the sneers of selfish men,\nNor greetings where no kindness is, nor all\nThe dreary intercourse of daily life,\nShall e'er prevail against us, or disturb\nOur cheerful faith, that all which we behold\nIs full of blessings.\n\nTherefore let the moon\nShine on thee in thy solitary walk;\nAnd let the misty mountain-winds be free\nTo blow against thee: and, in after years,\nWhen these wild ecstasies shall be matured\nInto a sober pleasure; when thy mind\nShall be a mansion for all lovely forms,\nThy memory be as a dwelling-place\nFor all sweet sounds and harmonies; oh! then,\nIf solitude, or fear, or pain, or grief,\nShould be thy portion, with what healing thoughts\nOf tender joy wilt thou remember me,\nAnd these my exhortations!

unhand me, grey-beard loon !'\nEftsoons his hand dropt he.\n\n[The Wedding-Guest is spell-bound by the eye of the old seafaring man, and constrained to hear his tale.\n\nHe holds him with his glittering eye--\nThe Wedding-Guest stood still,\nAnd listens like a three years' child:\nThe Mariner hath his will.\n\nThe Wedding-Guest sat on a stone;\nHe cannot choose but hear;\nAnd thus spake on that ancient man,\nThe bright-eyed Mariner.\n\n'The ship was cheered, the harbour cleared,\nMerrily did we drop\nBelow the kirk, below the hill,\nBelow the lighthouse top.\n\n[The Mariner tells how the ship sailed southward with a good wind and fair weather, till it reached the Line.\n\nThe Sun came up upon the left,\nOut of the sea came he!\nAnd he shone bright, and on the right\nWent down into the sea.\n\nHigher and higher every day,\nTill over the mast at noon--\nThe Wedding-Guest here beat his breast,\nFor he heard the loud bassoon.\n\n[The Wedding-Guest heareth the bridal music ; but the Mariner continueth his tale.\n\nThe bride hath paced into the hall,\nRed as a rose is she;\nNodding their heads before her goes\nThe merry minstrelsy.\n\nThe Wedding-Guest he beat his breast,\nYet he cannot choose but hear;\nAnd thus spake on that ancient man,\nThe bright-eyed Mariner.\n\n[The ship driven by a storm toward the south pole.\n\nAnd now the Storm-blast came, and he\nWas tyrannous and strong:\nHe struck with his o'ertaking wings,\nAnd chased us south along.\n\nWith sloping masts and dipping prow,\nAs who pursued with yell and blow\nStill treads the shadow of his foe,\nAnd forward bends his head,\nThe ship drove fast, loud roared the blast,\nThe southward aye we fled.\n\nAnd now there came both mist and snow,\nAnd it grew wondrous cold :\nAnd ice, mast-high, came floating by,\nAs green as emerald.\n\n[The land of ice, and of fearful sounds where no living thing was to be seen.\n\nAnd through the drifts the snowy clifts\nDid send a dismal sheen:\nNor shapes of men nor beasts we ken--\nThe ice was all between.\n\nThe ice was here, the ice was there,\nThe ice was all around:\nIt cracked and growled, and roared and howled,\nLike noises in a swound!\n[Till a great sea-bird, called the Albatross, came through the snow-fog, and was received with great joy and hospitality.\n\nAt length did cross an Albatross,\nThorough the fog it came;\nAs if it had been a Christian soul,\nWe hailed it in God's name.\n\nIt ate the food it ne'er had eat,\nAnd round and round it flew.\n\nThe ice did split with a thunder-fit;\nThe helmsman steered us through!\n[And lo! the Albatross proveth a bird of good omen, and followeth the ship as it returned northward through fog and floating ice.\n\nAnd a good south wind sprung up behind;\nThe Albatross did follow,\nAnd every day, for food or play,\nCame to the mariner's hollo!\nIn mist or cloud, on mast or shroud,\nIt perched for vespers nine;\nWhiles all the night, through fog-smoke white,\nGlimmered the white Moon-shine.\n\n[The ancient Mariner inhospitably killeth the pious bird of good omen.\n\n'God save thee, ancient Mariner!\nFrom the fiends, that plague thee thus!--\nWhy look'st thou so?\n\n' -- With my cross-bow\nI shot the Albatross.\n\nPART THE SECOND.\n\nThe Sun now rose upon the right\nOut of the sea came he,\nStill hid in mist, and on the left\nWent down into the sea.\n\nAnd the good south wind still blew behind,\nBut no sweet bird did follow,\nNor any day for food or play\nCame to the mariners' hollo !\n[His shipmates cry out against the ancient Mariner, for killing the bird of good luck.\n\nAnd I had done an hellish thing,\nAnd it would work 'em woe:\nFor all averred, I had killed the bird\nThat made the breeze to blow.\n\nAh wretch! said they, the bird to slay,\nThat made the breeze to blow !\n[But when the fog cleared off, they justify the same, and thus make themselves accomplices in the crime.\n\nNor dim nor red, like God's own head,\nThe glorious Sun uprist :\nThen all averred, I had killed the bird\nThat brought the fog and mist.\n\n'Twas right, said they, such birds to slay,\nThat bring the fog and mist.\n\n[The fair breeze continues; the ship enters the Pacific Ocean, and sails northward, even till it reaches the Line.\n\nThe ship hath been suddenly becalmed.\n\nThe fair breeze blew, the white foam flew,\nThe furrow followed free ;\nWe were the first that ever burst\nInto that silent sea.\n\nThe ship hath been suddenly becalmed.\n\nDown dropt the breeze, the sails dropt down,\n'Twas sad as sad could be;\nAnd we did speak only to break\nThe silence of the sea!\nAll in a hot and copper sky,\nThe bloody Sun, at noon,\nRight up above the mast did stand,\nNo bigger than the Moon.\n\nDay after day, day after day,\nWe stuck, nor breath nor motion;\nAs idle as a painted ship\nUpon a painted ocean.\n\n[And the Albatross begins to be avenged.\n\nWater, water, every where,\nAnd all the boards did shrink;\nWater, water, every where,\nNor any drop to drink.\n\nThe very deep did rot: O Christ !\nThat ever this should be !\nYea, slimy things did crawl with legs\nUpon the slimy sea.\n\nAbout, about, in reel and rout\nThe death-fires danced at night ;\nThe water, like a witch's oils,\nBurnt green, and blue and white.\n\n[A Spirit had followed them; one of the invisible inhabitants of this planet, neither departed souls nor angels; concerning whom the learned Jew, Josephus, and the Platonic Constantinopolitan, Michael Psellus, may be consulted.\n\nThey are very numerous, and there is no climate or element without one or more.\n\nAnd some in dreams assur\u00e9d were\nOf the Spirit that plagued us so:\nNine fathom deep he had followed us\nFrom the land of mist and snow.\n\nAnd every tongue, through utter drought,\nWas withered at the root;\nWe could not speak, no more than if\nWe had been choked with soot.\n\n[The shipmates, in their sore distress, would fain throw the whole guilt on the ancient Mariner: in sign whereof they hang the dead sea-bird round his neck.\n\nAh ! well a-day ! what evil looks\nHad I from old and young !\nInstead of the cross, the Albatross\nAbout my neck was hung.\n\nPART THE THIRD.\n\nThere passed a weary time.\n\nEach throat\nWas parched, and glazed each eye.\n\nA weary time ! a weary time !\nHow glazed each weary eye,\nWhen looking westward, I beheld\nA something in the sky.\n\n[The ancient Mariner beholdeth a sign in the element afar off.\n\nAt first it seemed a little speck,\nAnd then it seemed a mist;\nIt moved and moved, and took at last\nA certain shape, I wist.\n\nA speck, a mist, a shape, I wist!\nAnd still it neared and neared:\nAs if it dodged a water-sprite,\nIt plunged and tacked and veered.\n\n[At its nearer approach, it seemeth him to be a ship; and at a dear ransom he freeth his speech from the bonds of thirst.\n\nWith throats unslaked, with black lips baked,\nWe could nor laugh nor wail;\nThrough utter drought all dumb we stood !\nI bit my arm, I sucked the blood,\nAnd cried, A sail ! a sail!\n[A flash of joy.\n\nWith throats unslaked, with black lips baked,\nAgape they heard me call:\nGramercy ! they for joy did grin,\nAnd all at once their breath drew in,\nAs they were drinking all.\n\n[And horror follows.\n\nFor can it be a ship that comes onward without wind or tide?\n\nSee! see! (I cried) she tacks no more!\nHither to work us weal;\nWithout a breeze, without a tide,\nShe steadies with upright keel!\nThe western wave was all a-flame.\n\nThe day was well nigh done!\nAlmost upon the western wave\nRested the broad bright Sun;\nWhen that strange shape drove suddenly\nBetwixt us and the Sun.\n\n[It seemeth him but the skeleton of a ship.\n\nAnd straight the Sun was flecked with bars,\n(Heaven's Mother send us grace!)\nAs if through a dungeon-grate he peered\nWith broad and burning face.\n\nAnd its ribs are seen as bars on the face of the setting Sun.\n\nAlas ! (thought I, and my heart beat loud)\nHow fast she nears and nears!\nAre those her sails that glance in the Sun,\nLike restless gossameres?\n\n[The Spectre-Woman and her Death-mate, and no other on board the skeleton ship.\n\nLike vessel, like crew!]\nAnd those her ribs through which the Sun\nDid peer, as through a grate?\n\nAnd is that Woman all her crew?\n\nIs that a Death?\n\nand are there two?\n\nIs Death that woman's mate?\n\nHer lips were red, her looks were free,\nHer locks were yellow as gold :\nHer skin was as white as leprosy,\nThe Night-mare Life-in-Death was she,\nWho thicks man's blood with cold.\n\n[Death and Life-in-Death have diced for the ship's crew, and she (the latter) winneth the ancient Mariner.\n\nThe naked hulk alongside came,\nAnd the twain were casting dice;\n'The game is done ! I've won ! I've won!'\nQuoth she, and whistles thrice.\n\nNo twilight within the courts of the Sun.\n\nThe Sun's rim dips; the stars rush out:\nAt one stride comes the dark;\nWith far-heard whisper, o'er the sea,\nOff shot the spectre-bark.\n\n[At the rising of the Moon,]\nWe listened and looked sideways up !\nFear at my heart, as at a cup,\nMy life-blood seemed to sip!\nThe stars were dim, and thick the night,\nThe steerman's face by his lamp gleamed white;\nFrom the sails the dew did drip--\nTill clomb above the eastern bar\nThe horn\u00e9d Moon, with one bright star\nWithin the nether tip.\n\n[One after another,]\nOne after one, by the star-dogged Moon,\nToo quick for groan or sigh,\nEach turned his face with a ghastly pang,\nAnd cursed me with his eye.\n\n[His shipmates drop down dead.\n\nFour times fifty living men,\n(And I heard nor sigh nor groan)\nWith heavy thump, a lifeless lump,\nThey dropped down one by one.\n\n[But Life-in-Death begins her work on the ancient Mariner.\n\nThe souls did from their bodies fly,--\nThey fled to bliss or woe!\nAnd every soul, it passed me by,\nLike the whizz of my cross-bow!\nPART THE FOURTH.\n\n[The Wedding-Guest feareth that a Spirit is talking to him;]\n'I fear thee, ancient Mariner!\nI fear thy skinny hand!\nAnd thou art long, and lank, and brown,\nAs is the ribbed sea-sand.\n\nI fear thee and thy glittering eye,\nAnd thy skinny hand, so brown.\n\nFear not, fear not, thou Wedding-Guest!\nThis body dropt not down.\n\n[But the ancient Mariner assureth him of his bodily life, and proceedeth to relate his horrible penance.\n\nAlone, alone, all, all alone,\nAlone on a wide wide sea!\nAnd never a saint took pity on\nMy soul in agony.\n\n[He despiseth the creatures of the calm,]\nThe many men, so beautiful!\nAnd they all dead did lie:\nAnd a thousand thousand slimy things\nLived on; and so did I.\n\n[And envieth that they should live, and so many lie dead.\n\nI looked upon the rotting sea,\nAnd drew my eyes away;\nI looked upon the rotting deck,\nAnd there the dead men lay.\n\nI looked to heaven, and tried to pray;\nBut or ever a prayer had gusht,\nA wicked whisper came, and made\nMy heart as dry as dust.\n\nI closed my lids, and kept them close,\nAnd the balls like pulses beat;\nFor the sky and the sea, and the sea and the sky\nLay like a load on my weary eye,\nAnd the dead were at my feet.\n\nBut the curse liveth for him in the eye of the dead men.\n\nThe cold sweat melted from their limbs,\nNor rot nor reek did they:\nThe look with which they looked on me\nHad never passed away.\n\nAn orphan's curse would drag to hell\nA spirit from on high;\nBut oh ! more horrible than that\nIs the curse in a dead man's eye !\nSeven days, seven nights, I saw that curse,\nAnd yet I could not die.\n\n[In his loneliness and fixedness he yearneth towards the journeying Moon, and the stars that still sojourn, yet still move onward; and every where the blue sky belongs to them, and is their appointed rest, and their native country and their own natural homes, which they enter unannounced, as lords that are certainly expected and yet there is a silent joy at their arrival.\n\nThe moving Moon went up the sky,\nAnd no where did abide:\nSoftly she was going up,\nAnd a star or two beside--\nHer beams bemocked the sultry main,\nLike April hoar-frost spread;\nBut where the ship's huge shadow lay,\nThe charm\u00e9d water burnt alway\nA still and awful red.\n\n[By the light of the Moon he beholdeth God's creatures of the great calm.\n\nBeyond the shadow of the ship,\nI watched the water-snakes:\nThey moved in tracks of shining white,\nAnd when they reared, the elfish light\nFell off in hoary flakes.\n\nWithin the shadow of the ship\nI watched their rich attire:\nBlue, glossy green, and velvet black,\nThey coiled and swam; and every track\nWas a flash of golden fire.\n\n[Their beauty and their happiness.\n\n[He blesseth them in his heart.\n\nO happy living things ! no tongue\nTheir beauty might declare:\nA spring of love gushed from my heart,\nAnd I blessed them unaware:\nSure my kind saint took pity on me,\nAnd I blessed them unaware.\n\nThe spell begins to break.\n\nThe self-same moment I could pray;\nAnd from my neck so free\nThe Albatross fell off, and sank\nLike lead into the sea.\n\nPART THE FIFTH.\n\nOh sleep! it is a gentle thing,\nBeloved from pole to pole!\nTo Mary Queen the praise be given!\nShe sent the gentle sleep from Heaven,\nThat slid into my soul.\n\n[By grace of the holy Mother, the ancient Mariner is refreshed with rain.\n\nThe silly buckets on the deck,\nThat had so long remained,\nI dreamt that they were filled with dew;\nAnd when I awoke, it rained.\n\nMy lips were wet, my throat was cold,\nMy garments all were dank;\nSure I had drunken in my dreams,\nAnd still my body drank.\n\nI moved, and could not feel my limbs:\nI was so light -- almost\nI thought that I had died in sleep,\nAnd was a bless\u00e9d ghost.\n\n[He heareth sounds and seeth strange sights and commotions in the sky and the element.\n\nAnd soon I heard a roaring wind:\nIt did not come anear;\nBut with its sound it shook the sails,\nThat were so thin and sere.\n\nThe upper air burst into life !\nAnd a hundred fire-flags sheen,\nTo and fro they were hurried about !\nAnd to and fro, and in and out,\nThe wan stars danced between.\n\nAnd the coming wind did roar more loud,\nAnd the sails did sigh like sedge ;\nAnd the rain poured down from one black cloud ;\nThe Moon was at its edge.\n\nThe thick black cloud was cleft, and still\nThe Moon was at its side :\nLike waters shot from some high crag,\nThe lightning fell with never a jag,\nA river steep and wide.\n\n[The bodies of the ship's crew are inspired, and the ship moves on.\n\nThe loud wind never reached the ship,\nYet now the ship moved on!\nBeneath the lightning and the Moon\nThe dead men gave a groan.\n\nThey groaned, they stirred, they all uprose,\nNor spake, nor moved their eyes;\nIt had been strange, even in a dream,\nTo have seen those dead men rise.\n\nThe helmsman steered, the ship moved on;\nYet never a breeze up-blew;\nThe mariners all 'gan work the ropes,\nWhere they were wont to do;\nThey raised their limbs like lifeless tools--\nWe were a ghastly crew.\n\nThe body of my brother's son\nStood by me, knee to knee:\nThe body and I pulled at one rope,\nBut he said nought to me.\n\n[But not by the souls of the men, nor by d\u00e6mons of earth or middle air, but by a blessed troop of angelic spirits, sent down by the invocation of the guardian saint.\n\n'I fear thee, ancient Mariner!'\nBe calm, thou Wedding-Guest!\n'Twas not those souls that fled in pain,\nWhich to their corses came again,\nBut a troop of spirits blest:\nFor when it dawned -- they dropped their arms,\nAnd clustered round the mast;\nSweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths,\nAnd from their bodies passed.\n\nAround, around, flew each sweet sound,\nThen darted to the Sun;\nSlowly the sounds came back again,\nNow mixed, now one by one.\n\nSometimes a-dropping from the sky\nI heard the sky-lark sing;\nSometimes all little birds that are,\nHow they seemed to fill the sea and air\nWith their sweet jargoning!\nAnd now 'twas like all instruments,\nNow like a lonely flute;\nAnd now it is an angel's song,\nThat makes the heavens be mute.\n\nIt ceased; yet still the sails made on\nA pleasant noise till noon,\nA noise like of a hidden brook\nIn the leafy month of June,\nThat to the sleeping woods all night\nSingeth a quiet tune.\n\n[Additional stanzas, dropped after the first edition.\n\nTill noon we quietly sailed on,\nYet never a breeze did breathe:\nSlowly and smoothly went the ship,\nMoved onward from beneath.\n\n[The lonesome Spirit from the south-pole carries on the ship as far as the Line, in obedience to the angelic troop, but still requireth vengeance.\n\nUnder the keel nine fathom deep,\nFrom the land of mist and snow,\nThe spirit slid : and it was he\nThat made the ship to go.\n\nThe sails at noon left off their tune,\nAnd the ship stood still also.\n\nThe Sun, right up above the mast,\nHad fixed her to the ocea:\nBut in a minute she 'gan stir,\nWith a short uneasy motion--\nBackwards and forwards half her length\nWith a short uneasy motion.\n\nThen like a pawing horse let go,\nShe made a sudden bound:\nIt flung the blood into my head,\nAnd I fell down in a swound.\n\n[The Polar Spirit's fellow-d\u00e6mons, the invisible inhabitants of the element, take part in his wrong ; and two of them relate, one to the other, that penance long and heavy for the ancient Mariner hath been accorded to the Polar Spirit, who returneth southward.\n\nHow long in that same fit I lay,\nI have not to declare;\nBut ere my living life returned,\nI heard and in my soul discerned\nTwo voices in the air.\n\n'Is it he?\n\n' quoth one, 'Is this the man?\n\nBy him who died on cross,\nWith his cruel bow he laid full low\nThe harmless Albatross.\n\nThe spirit who bideth by himself\nIn the land of mist and snow,\nHe loved the bird that loved the man\nWho shot him with his bow.\n\nThe other was a softer voice,\nAs soft as honey-dew:\nQuoth he, 'The man hath penance done,\nAnd penance more will do.\n\nPART THE SIXTH.\n\nFIRST VOICE\n'But tell me, tell me ! speak again,\nThy soft response renewing--\nWhat makes that ship drive on so fast?\n\nWhat is the ocean doing?\n\nSECOND VOICE\n`Still as a slave before his lord,\nThe ocean hath no blast;\nHis great bright eye most silently\nUp to the Moon is cast--\nIf he may know which way to go;\nFor she guides him smooth or grim.\n\nSee, brother, see! how graciously\nShe looketh down on him.\n\n[The Mariner hath been cast into a trance; for the angelic power causeth the vessel to drive northward faster than human life could endure.\n\nFIRST VOICE\n'But why drives on that ship so fast,\nWithout or wave or wind?\n\nSECOND VOICE\n'The air is cut away before,\nAnd closes from behind.\n\nFly, brother, fly! more high, more high!\nOr we shall be belated:\nFor slow and slow that ship will go,\nWhen the Mariner's trance is abated.\n\n[The supernatural motion is retarded ; the Mariner awakes, and his penance begins anew.\n\nI woke, and we were sailing on\nAs in a gentle weather:\n'Twas night, calm night, the moon was high;\nThe dead men stood together.\n\nAll stood together on the deck,\nFor a charnel-dungeon fitter:\nAll fixed on me their stony eyes,\nThat in the Moon did glitter.\n\nThe pang, the curse, with which they died,\nHad never passed away:\nI could not draw my eyes from theirs,\nNor turn them up to pray.\n\n[The curse is finally expiated.\n\nAnd now this spell was snapt: once more\nI viewed the ocean green,\nAnd looked far forth, yet little saw\nOf what had else been seen--\nLike one, that on a lonesome road\nDoth walk in fear and dread,\nAnd having once turned round walks on,\nAnd turns no more his head;\nBecause he knows, a frightful fiend\nDoth close behind him tread.\n\nBut soon there breathed a wind on me,\nNor sound nor motion made:\nIts path was not upon the sea,\nIn ripple or in shade.\n\nIt raised my hair, it fanned my cheek\nLike a meadow-gale of spring--\nIt mingled strangely with my fears,\nYet it felt like a welcoming.\n\nSwiftly, swiftly flew the ship,\nYet she sailed softly too:\nSweetly, sweetly blew the breeze--\nOn me alone it blew.\n\n[And the ancient Mariner beholdeth his native country.\n\nOh! dream of joy! is this indeed\nThe light-house top I see?\n\nIs this the hill?\n\nis this the kirk?\n\nIs this mine own countree?\n\nWe drifted o'er the harbour-bar,\nAnd I with sobs did pray--\nO let me be awake, my God!\nOr let me sleep alway.\n\nThe harbour-bay was clear as glass,\nSo smoothly it was strewn!\nAnd on the bay the moonlight lay,\nAnd the shadow of the Moon.\n\n[Additional stanzas, dropped after the first edition.\n\nThe rock shone bright, the kirk no less,\nThat stands above the rock:\nThe moonlight steeped in silentness\nThe steady weathercock.\n\n[The angelic spirits leave the dead bodies,]\nAnd the bay was white with silent light,\nTill rising from the same,\nFull many shapes, that shadows were,\nIn crimson colours came.\n\n[And appear in their own forms of light.\n\nA little distance from the prow\nThose crimson shadows were:\nI turned my eyes upon the deck--\nOh, Christ! what saw I there!\nEach corse lay flat, lifeless and flat,\nAnd, by the holy rood!\nA man all light, a seraph-man,\nOn every corse there stood.\n\nThis seraph-band, each waved his hand:\nIt was a heavenly sight!\nThey stood as signals to the land,\nEach one a lovely light;\nThis seraph-band, each waved his hand,\nNo voice did they impart--\nNo voice; but oh ! the silence sank\nLike music on my heart.\n\nBut soon I heard the dash of oars,\nI heard the Pilot's cheer;\nMy head was turned perforce away\nAnd I saw a boat appear.\n\n[Additional stanza, dropped after the first edition.\n\nThe Pilot and the Pilot's boy,\nI heard them coming fast:\nDear Lord in Heaven ! it was a joy\nThe dead men could not blast.\n\nI saw a third -- I heard his voice:\nIt is the Hermit good!\nHe singeth loud his godly hymns\nThat he makes in the wood.\n\nHe'll shrieve my soul, he'll wash away\nThe Albatross's blood.\n\nPART THE SEVENTH.\n\nThe Hermit of the Wood,\nThis Hermit good lives in that wood\nWhich slopes down to the sea.\n\nHow loudly his sweet voice he rears!\nHe loves to talk with marineres\nThat come from a far countree.\n\nHe kneels at morn, and noon, and eve--\nHe hath a cushion plump:\nIt is the moss that wholly hides\nThe rotted old oak-stump.\n\nThe skiff-boat neared: I heard them talk,\n'Why, this is strange, I trow!\nWhere are those lights so many and fair,\nThat signal made but now?\n\n[Approacheth the ship with wonder.\n\n'Strange, by my faith!' the Hermit said--\n'And they answered not our cheer!\nThe planks looked warped! and see those sails,\nHow thin they are and sere!\nI never saw aught like to them,\nUnless perchance it were\nBrown skeletons of leaves that lag\nMy forest-brook along;\nWhen the ivy-tod is heavy with snow,\nAnd the owlet whoops to the wolf below,\nThat eats the she-wolf's young.\n\n'Dear Lord ! it hath a fiendish look--\n(The Pilot made reply)\nI am a-feared' -- 'Push on, push on!'\nSaid the Hermit cheerily.\n\nThe boat came closer to the ship,\nBut I nor spake nor stirred;\nThe boat came close beneath the ship,\nAnd straight a sound was heard.\n\n[The ship suddenly sinketh.\n\nUnder the water it rumbled on,\nStill louder and more dread:\nIt reached the ship, it split the bay;\nThe ship went down like lead.\n\n[The ancient Mariner is saved in the Pilot's boat.\n\nStunned by that loud and dreadful sound,\nWhich sky and ocean smote,\nLike one that hath been seven days drowned\nMy body lay afloat;\nBut swift as dreams, myself I found\nWithin the Pilot's boat.\n\nUpon the whirl, where sank the ship,\nThe boat spun round and round;\nAnd all was still, save that the hill\nWas telling of the sound.\n\nI moved my lips -- the Pilot shrieked\nAnd fell down in a fit;\nThe holy Hermit raised his eyes,\nAnd prayed where he did sit.\n\nI took the oars: the Pilot's boy,\nWho now doth crazy go,\nLaughed loud and long, and all the while\nHis eyes went to and fro.\n\n'Ha!

at all hours?\n\nBut ever in the noonlight\nShe pined and pined away;\nSought them by night and day,\nFound them no more, but dwindled and grew grey;\nThen fell with the first snow,\nWhile to this day no grass will grow\nWhere she lies low:\nI planted daisies there a year ago\nThat never blow.\n\nYou should not loiter so.\n\n\u201cNay, hush,\u201d said Laura:\n\u201cNay, hush, my sister:\nI ate and

flame.\n\nThey drew the gurgling water from its deep;\nLizzie pluck\u2019d purple and rich golden flags,\nThen turning homeward said: \u201cThe sunset flushes\nThose furthest loftiest crags;\nCome, Laura, not another maiden lags.\n\nNo wilful squirrel wags,\nThe beasts and birds are fast asleep.\n\nBut Laura loiter\u2019d still among the rushes\nAnd said the bank was steep.\n\nAnd said the hour was early still\nThe dew not fall\u2019n, the wind not chill;\nListening ever, but not catching\nThe customary cry,\n\u201cCome buy, come buy,\u201d\nWith its iterated jingle\nOf sugar-baited words:\nNot for all her watching\nOnce discerning even one goblin\nRacing, whisking, tumbling, hobbling;\nLet alone the herds\nThat used to tramp along the glen,\nIn groups or single,\nOf brisk fruit-merchant men.\n\nTill Lizzie urged, \u201cO Laura, come;\nI hear the fruit-call but I dare not look:\nYou should not loiter longer at this brook:\nCome with me home.\n\nThe stars rise, the moon bends her arc,\nEach glowworm winks her spark,\nLet us get home before the night grows dark:\nFor clouds may gather\nThough this is summer weather,\nPut out the lights and drench us through;\nThen if we lost our way what should we do?\n\n\nLaura turn\u2019d cold as stone\nTo find her sister heard that cry alone,\nThat goblin cry,\n\u201cCome buy our fruits, come buy.\n\nMust she then buy no more such dainty fruit?\n\nMust she no more such succous pasture find,\nGone deaf and blind?\n\nHer tree of life droop\u2019d from the root:\nShe said not one word in her heart\u2019s sore ache;\nBut peering thro\u2019 the dimness, nought discerning,\nTrudg\u2019d home, her pitcher dripping all the way;\nSo crept to bed, and lay\nSilent till Lizzie slept;\nThen sat up in a passionate yearning,\nAnd gnash\u2019d her teeth for baulk\u2019d desire, and wept\nAs if her heart would break.\n\nDay after day, night after night,\nLaura kept watch in vain\nIn sullen silence of exceeding pain.\n\nShe never caught again the goblin cry:\n\u201cCome buy, come buy;\u201d\u2014\nShe never spied the goblin men\nHawking their fruits along the glen:\nBut when the noon wax\u2019d bright\nHer hair grew thin and grey;\nShe dwindled, as the fair full moon doth turn\nTo swift decay and burn\nHer fire away.\n\nOne day remembering her kernel-stone\nShe set it by a wall that faced the south;\nDew\u2019d it with tears, hoped for a root,\nWatch\u2019d for a waxing shoot,\nBut there came none;\nIt never saw the sun,\nIt never felt the trickling moisture run:\nWhile with sunk eyes and faded mouth\nShe dream\u2019d of melons, as a traveller sees\nFalse waves in desert drouth\nWith shade of leaf-crown\u2019d trees,\nAnd burns the thirstier in the sandful breeze.\n\nShe no more swept the house,\nTended the fowls or cows,\nFetch\u2019d honey, kneaded cakes of wheat,\nBrought water from the brook:\nBut sat down listless in the chimney-nook\nAnd would not eat.\n\nTender Lizzie could not bear\nTo watch her sister\u2019s cankerous care\nYet not to share.\n\nShe night and morning\nCaught the goblins\u2019 cry:\n\u201cCome buy our orchard fruits,\nCome buy, come buy;\u201d\u2014\nBeside the brook, along the glen,\nShe heard the tramp of goblin men,\nThe yoke and stir\nPoor Laura could not hear;\nLong\u2019d to buy fruit to comfort her,\nBut fear\u2019d to pay too dear.\n\nShe thought of Jeanie in her grave,\nWho should have been a bride;\nBut who for joys brides hope to have\nFell sick and died\nIn her gay prime,\nIn earliest winter time\nWith the first glazing rime,\nWith the first snow-fall of crisp winter time.\n\nTill Laura dwindling\nSeem\u2019d knocking at Death\u2019s door:\nThen Lizzie weigh\u2019d no more\nBetter and worse;\nBut put a silver penny in her purse,\nKiss\u2019d Laura, cross\u2019d the heath with clumps of furze\nAt twilight, halted by the brook:\nAnd for the first time in her life\nBegan to listen and look.\n\nLaugh\u2019d every goblin\nWhen they spied her peeping:\nCame towards her hobbling,\nFlying, running, leaping,\nPuffing and blowing,\nChuckling, clapping, crowing,\nClucking and gobbling,\nMopping and mowing,\nFull of airs and graces,\nPulling wry faces,\nDemure grimaces,\nCat-like and rat-like,\nRatel- and wombat-like,\nSnail-paced in a hurry,\nParrot-voiced and whistler,\nHelter skelter, hurry skurry,\nChattering like magpies,\nFluttering like pigeons,\nGliding like fishes,\u2014\nHugg\u2019d her and kiss\u2019d her:\nSqueez\u2019d and caress\u2019d her:\nStretch\u2019d up their dishes,\nPanniers, and plates:\n\u201cLook at our apples\nRusset and dun,\nBob at our cherries,\nBite at our peaches,\nCitrons and dates,\nGrapes for the asking,\nPears red with basking\nOut in the sun,\nPlums on their twigs;\nPluck them and suck them,\nPomegranates, figs.\n\n\n\u201cGood folk,\u201d said Lizzie,\nMindful of Jeanie:\n\u201cGive me much and many: \u2014\nHeld out her apron,\nToss\u2019d them her penny.\n\n\u201cNay, take a seat with us,\nHonour and eat with us,\u201d\nThey answer\u2019d grinning:\n\u201cOur feast is but beginning.\n\nNight yet is early,\nWarm and dew-pearly,\nWakeful and starry:\nSuch fruits as these\nNo man can carry:\nHalf their bloom would fly,\nHalf their dew would dry,\nHalf their flavour would pass by.\n\nSit down and feast with us,\nBe welcome guest with us,\nCheer you and rest with us.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Lizzie: \u201cBut one waits\nAt home alone for me:\nSo without further parleying,\nIf you will not sell me any\nOf your fruits though much and many,\nGive me back my silver penny\nI toss\u2019d you for a fee.\n\nThey began to scratch their pates,\nNo longer wagging, purring,\nBut visibly demurring,\nGrunting and snarling.\n\nOne call\u2019d her proud,\nCross-grain\u2019d, uncivil;\nTheir tones wax\u2019d loud,\nTheir looks were evil.\n\nLashing their tails\nThey trod and hustled her,\nElbow\u2019d and jostled her,\nClaw\u2019d with their nails,\nBarking, mewing, hissing, mocking,\nTore her gown and soil\u2019d her stocking,\nTwitch\u2019d her hair out by the roots,\nStamp\u2019d upon her tender feet,\nHeld her hands and squeez\u2019d their fruits\nAgainst her mouth to make her eat.\n\nWhite and golden Lizzie stood,\nLike a lily in a flood,\u2014\nLike a rock of blue-vein\u2019d stone\nLash\u2019d by tides obstreperously,\u2014\nLike a beacon left alone\nIn a hoary roaring sea,\nSending up a golden fire,\u2014\nLike a fruit-crown\u2019d orange-tree\nWhite with blossoms honey-sweet\nSore beset by wasp and bee,\u2014\nLike a royal virgin town\nTopp\u2019d with gilded dome and spire\nClose beleaguer\u2019d by a fleet\nMad to tug her standard down.\n\nOne may lead a horse to water,\nTwenty cannot make him drink.\n\nThough the goblins cuff\u2019d and caught her,\nCoax\u2019d and fought her,\nBullied and besought her,\nScratch\u2019d her, pinch\u2019d her black as ink,\nKick\u2019d and knock\u2019d her,\nMaul\u2019d and mock\u2019d her,\nLizzie utter\u2019d not a word;\nWould not open lip from lip\nLest they should cram a mouthful in:\nBut laugh\u2019d in heart to feel the drip\nOf juice that syrupp\u2019d all her face,\nAnd lodg\u2019d in dimples of her chin,\nAnd streak\u2019d her neck which quaked like curd.\n\nAt last the evil people,\nWorn out by her resistance,\nFlung back her penny, kick\u2019d their fruit\nAlong whichever road they took,\nNot leaving root or stone or shoot;\nSome writh\u2019d into the ground,\nSome div\u2019d into the brook\nWith ring and ripple,\nSome scudded on the gale without a sound,\nSome vanish\u2019d in the distance.\n\nIn a smart, ache, tingle,\nLizzie went her way;\nKnew not was it night or day;\nSprang up the bank, tore thro\u2019 the furze,\nThreaded copse and dingle,\nAnd heard her penny jingle\nBouncing in her purse,\u2014\nIts bounce was music to her ear.\n\nShe ran and ran\nAs if she fear\u2019d some goblin man\nDogg\u2019d her with gibe or curse\nOr something worse:\nBut not one goblin scurried after,\nNor was she prick\u2019d by fear;\nThe kind heart made her windy-paced\nThat urged her home quite out of breath with haste\nAnd inward laughter.\n\nShe cried, \u201cLaura,\u201d up the garden,\n\u201cDid you miss me?\n\nCome and kiss me.\n\nNever mind my bruises,\nHug me, kiss me, suck my juices\nSqueez\u2019d from goblin fruits for you,\nGoblin pulp and goblin dew.\n\nEat me, drink me, love me;\nLaura, make much of me;\nFor your sake I have braved the glen\nAnd had to do with goblin merchant men.\n\n\nLaura started from her chair,\nFlung her arms up in the air,\nClutch\u2019d her hair:\n\u201cLizzie, Lizzie, have you tasted\nFor my sake the fruit forbidden?\n\nMust your light like mine be hidden,\nYour young life like mine be wasted,\nUndone in mine undoing,\nAnd ruin\u2019d in my ruin,\nThirsty, canker\u2019d, goblin-ridden?\n\nShe clung about her sister,\nKiss\u2019d and kiss\u2019d and kiss\u2019d her:\nTears once again\nRefresh\u2019d her shrunken eyes,\nDropping like rain\nAfter long sultry drouth;\nShaking with aguish fear, and pain,\nShe kiss\u2019d and kiss\u2019d her with a hungry mouth.\n\nHer lips began to scorch,\nThat juice was wormwood to her tongue,\nShe loath\u2019d the feast:\nWrithing as one possess\u2019d she leap\u2019d and sung,\nRent all her robe, and wrung\nHer hands in lamentable haste,\nAnd beat her breast.\n\nHer locks stream\u2019d like the torch\nBorne by a racer at full speed,\nOr like the mane of horses in their flight,\nOr like an eagle when she stems the light\nStraight toward the sun,\nOr like a caged thing freed,\nOr like a flying flag when armies run.\n\nSwift fire spread through her veins, knock\u2019d at her heart,\nMet the fire smouldering there\nAnd overbore its lesser flame;\nShe gorged on bitterness without a name:\nAh! fool, to choose such part\nOf soul-consuming care!\nSense fail\u2019d in the mortal strife:\nLike the watch-tower of a town\nWhich an earthquake shatters down,\nLike a lightning-stricken mast,\nLike a wind-uprooted tree\nSpun about,\nLike a foam-topp\u2019d waterspout\nCast down headlong in the sea,\nShe fell at last;\nPleasure past and anguish past,\nIs it death or is it life?\n\nLife out of death.\n\nThat night long Lizzie watch\u2019d by her,\nCounted her pulse\u2019s flagging stir,\nFelt for her breath,\nHeld water to her lips, and cool\u2019d her face\nWith tears and fanning leaves:\nBut when the first birds chirp\u2019d about their eaves,\nAnd early reapers plodded to the place\nOf golden sheaves,\nAnd dew-wet grass\nBow\u2019d in the morning winds so brisk to pass,\nAnd new buds with new day\nOpen\u2019d of cup-like lilies on the stream,\nLaura awoke as from a dream,\nLaugh\u2019d in the innocent old way,\nHugg\u2019d Lizzie but not twice or thrice;\nHer gleaming locks show\u2019d not one thread of grey,\nHer breath was sweet as May\nAnd light danced in her eyes.\n\nDays, weeks, months, years\nAfterwards, when both were wives\nWith children of their own;\nTheir mother-hearts beset with fears,\nTheir lives bound up in tender lives;\nLaura would call the little ones\nAnd tell them of her early prime,\nThose pleasant days long gone\nOf not-returning time:\nWould talk about the haunted glen,\nThe wicked, quaint fruit-merchant men,\nTheir fruits like honey to the throat\nBut poison in the blood;\n(Men sell not such in any town):\nWould tell them how her sister stood\nIn deadly peril to do her good,\nAnd win the fiery antidote:\nThen joining hands to little hands\nWould bid them cling together,\n\u201cFor there is no friend like a sister\nIn calm or stormy weather;\nTo cheer one on the tedious way,\nTo fetch one if one goes astray,\nTo lift one if one totters down,\nTo strengthen whilst one stands.\n", "period": "Victorian", "literary_movement": "Pre-Raphaelite", "register": "Cautionary",

dooryard fronting an old farm-house near the white-wash\u2019d palings,\nStands the lilac-bush tall-growing with heart-shaped leaves of rich green,\nWith many a pointed blossom rising delicate, with the perfume strong I love,\nWith every leaf a miracle\u2014and from this bush in the dooryard,\nWith delicate-color\u2019d blossoms and heart-shaped leaves of rich green,\nA sprig with its flower I break.\n\n4\nIn the swamp in secluded recesses,\nA shy and hidden bird is warbling a song.\n\nSolitary the thrush,\nThe hermit withdrawn to himself, avoiding the settlements,\nSings by himself a song.\n\nSong of the bleeding throat,\nDeath\u2019s outlet song of life, (for well dear brother I know,\nIf thou wast not granted to sing thou would\u2019st surely die.\n\n\n5\nOver the breast of the spring, the land, amid cities,\nAmid lanes and through old woods, where lately the violets peep\u2019d from the ground, spotting the gray debris,\nAmid the grass in the fields each side of the lanes, passing the endless grass,\nPassing the yellow-spear\u2019d wheat, every grain from its shroud in the dark-brown fields uprisen,\nPassing the apple-tree blows of white and pink in the

wander\u2019d together the solemn night, (for something I know not what kept me from sleep,)\nAs the night advanced, and I saw on the rim of the west how full you were of woe,\nAs I stood on the rising ground in the breeze in the cool transparent night,\nAs I watch\u2019d where you pass\u2019d and was lost in the netherward black of the night,\nAs my soul in its trouble dissatisfied sank, as where you sad orb,\nConcluded, dropt in the night, and was gone.\n\n9\nSing on there in the swamp,\nO singer bashful and tender, I hear your notes, I hear your call,\nI hear, I come presently, I

loved?\n\nAnd how shall I deck my song for the large sweet soul that has gone?\n\nAnd what shall my perfume be for the grave of him I love?\n\nSea-winds blown from east and west,\nBlown from the

on the chamber walls?\n\nAnd what shall the pictures be that I hang on the walls,\nTo adorn the burial-house of him I love?\n\nPictures of growing spring and farms and homes,\nWith the Fourth-month eve at sundown, and the gray smoke lucid and bright,\nWith floods of the yellow gold of the gorgeous, indolent, sinking sun, burning, expanding the air,\nWith the fresh sweet herbage under foot, and the pale green leaves of the trees prolific,\nIn the distance the flowing glaze, the breast of the river, with a wind-dapple here and there,\nWith ranging hills on the banks, with many a line against the sky, and shadows,\nAnd the city at hand with dwellings so dense, and stacks of chimneys,\nAnd all the scenes of life and the workshops, and the workmen homeward returning.\n\n12\nLo, body and soul\u2014this land,\nMy own Manhattan with spires, and the sparkling and hurrying tides, and the ships,\nThe varied and ample land, the South and the North in the light, Ohio\u2019s shores and flashing Missouri,\nAnd ever the far-spreading prairies cover\u2019d with grass and corn.\n\nLo, the most excellent sun so calm and haughty,\nThe violet and purple morn with just-felt breezes,\nThe gentle soft-born measureless light,\nThe miracle spreading bathing all, the fulfill\u2019d noon,\nThe coming eve delicious, the welcome night and the stars,\nOver my cities shining all, enveloping man and land.\n\n13\nSing on, sing on you gray-brown bird,\nSing from the swamps, the recesses, pour your chant from the bushes,\nLimitless out of the dusk, out of the cedars and pines.\n\nSing on dearest brother, warble your reedy song,\nLoud human song, with voice of uttermost woe.\n\nO liquid and free and tender!\nO wild and loose to my soul\u2014O wondrous singer!\nYou only I hear\u2014yet the star holds me, (but will soon depart,)\nYet the lilac with mastering odor holds me.\n\n14\nNow while I sat in the day and look\u2019d forth,\nIn the close of the day with its light and the fields of spring, and the farmers preparing their crops,\nIn the large unconscious scenery of my land with its lakes and forests,\nIn the heavenly aerial beauty, (after the perturb\u2019d winds and the storms,)\nUnder the arching heavens of the afternoon swift passing, and the voices of children and women,\nThe many-moving sea-tides, and I saw the ships how they sail\u2019d,\nAnd the summer approaching with richness, and the fields all busy with labor,\nAnd the infinite separate houses, how they all went on, each with its meals and minutia of daily usages,\nAnd the streets how their throbbings throbb\u2019d, and the cities pent\u2014lo, then and there,\nFalling upon them all and among them all, enveloping me with the rest,\nAppear\u2019d the cloud, appear\u2019d the long black trail,\nAnd I knew death, its thought, and the sacred knowledge of death.\n\nThen with the knowledge of death as walking one side of me,\nAnd the thought of death close-walking the other side of me,\nAnd I in the middle as with companions, and as holding the hands of companions,\nI fled forth to the hiding receiving night that talks not,\nDown to the shores of the water, the path by the swamp in the dimness,\nTo the solemn shadowy cedars and ghostly pines so still.\n\nAnd the singer so shy to the rest receiv\u2019d me,\nThe gray-brown bird I know receiv\u2019d us comrades three,\nAnd he sang the carol of death, and a verse for him I love.\n\nFrom deep secluded recesses,\nFrom the fragrant cedars and the ghostly pines so still,\nCame the carol of the bird.\n\nAnd the charm of the carol rapt me,\nAs I held as if by their hands my comrades in the night,\nAnd the voice of my spirit tallied the song of the bird.\n\nCome lovely and soothing death,\nUndulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriving,\nIn the day, in the night, to all, to each,\nSooner or later delicate death.\n\nPrais\u2019d be the fathomless universe,\nFor life and joy, and for objects and knowledge curious,\nAnd for love, sweet love\u2014but praise! praise! praise!\nFor the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding death.\n\nDark mother always gliding near with soft feet,\nHave none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome?\n\nThen I chant it for thee, I glorify thee above all,\nI bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come, come unfalteringly.\n\nApproach strong deliveress,\nWhen it is so, when thou hast taken them I joyously sing the dead,\nLost in the loving floating ocean of thee,\nLaved in the flood of thy bliss O death.\n\nFrom me to thee glad serenades,\nDances for thee I propose saluting thee, adornments and feastings for thee,\nAnd the sights of the open landscape and the high-spread sky are fitting,\nAnd life and the fields, and the huge and thoughtful night.\n\nThe night in silence under many a star,\nThe ocean shore and the husky whispering wave whose voice I know,\nAnd the soul turning to thee O vast and well-veil\u2019d death,\nAnd the body gratefully nestling close to thee.\n\nOver the tree-tops I float thee a song,\nOver the rising and sinking waves, over the myriad fields and the prairies wide,\nOver the dense-pack\u2019d cities all and the teeming wharves and ways,\nI float this carol with joy, with joy to thee O death.\n\n15\nTo the tally of my soul,\nLoud and strong kept up the gray-brown bird,\nWith pure deliberate notes spreading filling the night.\n\nLoud in the pines and cedars dim,\nClear in the freshness moist and the swamp-perfume,\nAnd I with my comrades there in the night.\n\nWhile my sight that was bound in my eyes unclosed,\nAs to long panoramas of visions.\n\nAnd I saw askant the armies,\nI saw as in noiseless dreams hundreds of battle-flags,\nBorne through the smoke of the battles and pierc\u2019d with missiles I saw them,\nAnd carried hither and yon through the smoke, and torn and bloody,\nAnd at last but a few shreds left on the staffs, (and all in silence,)\nAnd the staffs all splinter\u2019d and broken.\n\nI saw battle-corpses, myriads of them,\nAnd the white skeletons of young men, I saw them,\nI saw the debris and debris of all the slain soldiers of the war,\nBut I saw they were not as was thought,\nThey themselves were fully at rest, they suffer\u2019d not,\nThe living remain\u2019d and suffer\u2019d, the mother suffer\u2019d,\nAnd the wife and the child and the musing comrade suffer\u2019d,\nAnd the armies that remain\u2019d suffer\u2019d.\n\n16\nPassing the visions, passing the night,\nPassing, unloosing the hold of my comrades\u2019 hands,\nPassing the song of the hermit bird and the tallying song of my soul,\nVictorious song, death\u2019s outlet song, yet varying ever-altering song,\nAs low and wailing, yet clear the notes, rising and falling, flooding the night,\nSadly sinking and fainting, as warning and warning, and yet again bursting with joy,\nCovering the earth and filling the spread of the heaven,\nAs that powerful psalm in the night I heard from recesses,\nPassing, I leave thee lilac with heart-shaped leaves,\nI leave thee there in the door-yard, blooming, returning with spring.\n\nI cease from my song for thee,\nFrom my gaze on thee in the west, fronting the west, communing with thee,\nO comrade lustrous with silver face in the night.\n\nYet each to keep and all, retrievements out of the night,\nThe song, the wondrous chant of the gray-brown bird,\nAnd the tallying chant, the echo arous\u2019d in my soul,\nWith the lustrous and drooping star with the countenance full of woe,\nWith the holders holding my hand nearing the call of the bird,\nComrades mine and I in the midst, and their memory ever to keep, for the dead I loved so well,\nFor the sweetest, wisest soul of all my days and lands\u2014and this for his dear sake,\nLilac and star and bird twined with the chant of my soul,\nThere in the fragrant pines and the cedars dusk and dim.\n", "period": "Victorian", "literary_movement": "", "register": "Elegiac",

your owne mishaps to mourne,\nWhich death, or love, or fortunes wreck did rayse,\nYour string could soone to sadder tenor turne,\nAnd teach the woods and waters to lament\nYour dolefull

race,\nClad all in white, that seemes a virgin best.\n\nSo well it her beseemes that ye would weene\nSome angell she had beene.\n\nHer long loose yellow locks lyke golden wyre,\nSprinckled with perle, and perling flowres a tweene,\nDoe lyke a golden mantle her attyre,\nAnd being crowned with a girland greene,\nSeeme lyke some mayden Queene.\n\nHer modest eyes abashed to behold\nSo many gazers, as on her do stare,\nUpon the lowly ground affixed are.\n\nNe dare lift up her countenance too bold,\nBut blush to heare her prayses sung so loud,\nSo farre from being proud.\n\nNathlesse doe ye still loud her prayses sing,\nThat all the woods may answer and your eccho ring.\n\nTell me ye merchants daughters did ye see\nSo fayre a creature in your towne before?\n\nSo sweet, so lovely, and so mild as she,\nAdornd with beautyes grace and vertues store,\nHer goodly eyes lyke Saphyres shining bright,\nHer forehead yvory white,\nHer cheekes lyke apples which the sun hath rudded,\nHer lips lyke

her cheekes,\nAnd the pure snow with goodly vermill stayne,\nLike crimsin dyde in grayne,\nThat even th'Angels which continually,\nAbout the sacred Altare doe remaine,\nForget their service and about her fly,\nOfte peeping in her face that seemes more fayre,\nThe more they on it stare.\n\nBut her sad eyes still fastened on the ground,\nAre governed with goodly modesty,\nThat suffers not one looke to glaunce awry,\nWhich may let in a little thought unsownd.\n\nWhy blush ye love to give to me your hand,\nThe pledge of all our band?\n\nSing ye sweet Angels, Alleluya sing,\nThat all the woods may

downe,\nThat ye for ever it remember may.\n\nThis day the sunne is in his chiefest hight,\nWith Barnaby the bright,\nFrom whence declining daily by degrees,\nHe somewhat loseth of his heat and light,\nWhen once the Crab behind his back he sees.\n\nBut for this time it ill ordained was,\nTo chose the longest day in all the yeare,\nAnd shortest night, when longest fitter weare:\nYet never day so long, but late would passe.\n\nRing ye the bels, to make it weare away,\nAnd bonefiers make all day,\nAnd daunce about them, and about them sing:\nThat all the woods may answer, and your eccho ring.\n\nAh when will this long weary day have end,\nAnd lende me leave to come unto my love?\n\nHow slowly do the houres theyr numbers spend?\n\nHow slowly does sad Time his feathers move?\n\nHast thee O fayrest Planet to thy home\nWithin the Westerne fome:\nThy tyred steedes long since have need of rest.\n\nLong though it be, at last I see it gloome,\nAnd the bright evening star with golden creast\nAppeare out of the East.\n\nFayre childe of beauty, glorious lampe of love\nThat all the host of heaven in rankes doost lead,\nAnd guydest lovers through the nightes dread,\nHow chearefully thou lookest from above,\nAnd seemst to laugh atweene thy twinkling light\nAs joying in the sight\nOf these glad many which for joy doe sing,\nThat all the woods them answer and their echo ring.\n\nNow ceasse ye damsels your delights forepast;\nEnough is it, that all the day was youres:\nNow day is doen, and night is nighing fast:\nNow bring the Bryde into the brydall boures.\n\nNow night is come, now soone her disaray,\nAnd in her bed her lay;\nLay her in lillies and in violets,\nAnd silken courteins over her display,\nAnd odourd sheetes, and Arras coverlets.\n\nBehold how goodly my faire love does ly\nIn proud humility;\nLike unto Maia, when as Jove her tooke,\nIn Tempe, lying on the flowry gras,\nTwixt sleepe and wake, after she weary was,\nWith bathing in the Acidalian brooke.\n\nNow it is night, ye damsels may be gon,\nAnd leave my love alone,\nAnd leave likewise your former lay to sing:\nThe woods no more shal answere, nor your echo ring.\n\nNow welcome night, thou night so long expected,\nThat long daies labour doest at last defray,\nAnd all my cares, which cruell love collected,\nHast sumd in one, and cancelled for aye:\nSpread thy broad wing over my love and me,\nThat no man may us see,\nAnd in thy sable mantle us enwrap,\nFrom feare of perrill and foule horror free.\n\nLet no false treason seeke us to entrap,\nNor any dread disquiet once annoy\nThe safety of our joy:\nBut let the night be calme and quietsome,\nWithout tempestuous storms or sad afray:\nLyke as when Jove with fayre Alcmena lay,\nWhen he begot the great Tirynthian groome:\nOr lyke as when he with thy selfe did lie,\nAnd begot Majesty.\n\nAnd let the mayds and yongmen cease to sing:\nNe let the woods them answer, nor theyr eccho ring.\n\nLet no lamenting cryes, nor dolefull teares,\nBe heard all night within nor yet without:\nNe let false whispers, breeding hidden feares,\nBreake gentle sleepe with misconceived dout.\n\nLet no deluding dreames, nor dreadful sights\nMake sudden sad affrights;\nNe let housefyres, nor lightnings helpelesse harmes,\nNe let the Pouke, nor other evill sprights,\nNe let mischivous witches with theyr charmes,\nNe let hob Goblins, names whose sence we see not,\nFray us with things that be not.\n\nLet not the shriech Oule, nor the Storke be heard:\nNor the night Raven that still deadly yels,\nNor damned ghosts cald up with mighty spels,\nNor griesly vultures make us once affeard:\nNe let th'unpleasant Quyre of Frogs still croking\nMake us to wish theyr choking.\n\nLet none of these theyr drery accents sing;\nNe let the woods them answer, nor theyr eccho ring.\n\nBut let stil Silence trew night watches keepe,\nThat sacred peace may in assurance rayne,\nAnd tymely sleep, when it is tyme to sleepe,\nMay poure his limbs forth on your pleasant playne,\nThe whiles an hundred little winged loves,\nLike divers fethered doves,\nShall fly and flutter round about your bed,\nAnd in the secret darke, that none reproves,\nTheir prety stelthes shal worke, and snares shal spread\nTo filch away sweet snatches of delight,\nConceald through covert night.\n\nYe sonnes of Venus, play your sports at will,\nFor greedy pleasure, carelesse of your toyes,\nThinks more upon her paradise of joyes,\nThen what ye do, albe it good or ill.\n\nAll night therefore attend your merry play,\nFor it will soone be day:\nNow none doth hinder you, that say or sing,\nNe will the woods now answer, nor your Eccho ring.\n\nWho is the same, which at my window peepes?\n\nOr whose is that faire face, that shines so bright,\nIs it not Cinthia, she that never sleepes,\nBut walkes about high heaven al the night?\n\nO fayrest goddesse, do thou not envy\nMy love with me to spy:\nFor thou likewise didst love, though now unthought,\nAnd for a fleece of woll, which privily,\nThe Latmian shephard once unto thee brought,\nHis pleasures with thee wrought.\n\nTherefore to us be favorable now;\nAnd sith of wemens labours thou hast charge,\nAnd generation goodly dost enlarge,\nEncline thy will t'effect our wishfull vow,\nAnd the chast wombe informe with timely seed,\nThat may our comfort breed:\nTill which we cease our hopefull hap to sing,\nNe let the woods us answere, nor our Eccho ring.\n\nAnd thou great Juno, which with awful might\nThe lawes of wedlock still dost patronize,\nAnd the religion of the faith first plight\nWith sacred rites hast taught to solemnize:\nAnd eeke for comfort often called art\nOf women in their smart,\nEternally bind thou this lovely band,\nAnd all thy blessings unto us impart.\n\nAnd thou glad Genius, in whose gentle hand,\nThe bridale bowre and geniall bed remaine,\nWithout blemish or staine,\nAnd the sweet pleasures of theyr loves delight\nWith secret ayde doest succour and supply,\nTill they bring forth the fruitfull progeny,\nSend us the timely fruit of this same night.\n\nAnd thou fayre Hebe, and thou Hymen free,\nGrant that it may so be.\n\nTil which we cease your further prayse to sing,\nNe any woods shal answer, nor your Eccho ring.\n\nAnd ye high heavens, the temple of the gods,\nIn which a thousand torches flaming bright\nDoe burne, that to us wretched earthly clods,\nIn dreadful darknesse lend desired light;\nAnd all ye powers which in the same remayne,\nMore then we men can fayne,\nPoure out your blessing on us plentiously,\nAnd happy influence upon us raine,\nThat we may raise a large posterity,\nWhich from the earth, which they may long possesse,\nWith lasting happinesse,\nUp to your haughty pallaces may mount,\nAnd for the guerdon of theyr glorious merit\nMay heavenly tabernacles there inherit,\nOf blessed Saints for to increase the count.\n\nSo let us rest, sweet love, in hope of this,\nAnd cease till then our tymely joyes to sing,\nThe woods no more us answer, nor our eccho ring.\n\nSong made in lieu of many ornaments,\nWith which my love should duly have bene dect,\nWhich cutting off through hasty accidents,\nYe

she had a right\nTo a blessing from the light;\nTitle-deeds to sky and earth\nGod gave to her at her birth;\nBut, before they were enjoyed,\nPoverty had made them void,\nAnd had drunk the sunshine up\nFrom all nature's ample cup,\nLeaving her a first-born's share\nIn the dregs of darkness there.\n\nOften, on the sidewalk bleak,\nHungry, all alone, and weak,\nShe has seen, in night and storm,\nRooms o'erflow with firelight warm,\nWhich, outside the window-glass,\nDoubled all the cold, alas!\nTill each ray that on her fell\nStabbed her like an icicle,\nAnd she almost loved the wail\nOf the bloodhounds on her trail.\n\nTill the floor becomes her bier,\nShe shall feel their pantings near,\nClose upon her very heels,\nSpite of all the din of wheels;\nShivering on her pallet poor,\nShe shall hear them at the door\nWhine and scratch to be let in,\nSister bloodhounds, Want and Sin!\nHark!

all their pride\nWhen such a Phoenix once they had espied.\n\nEach arbor, bank, each seat, each stately tree,\nThought themselves honored in supporting thee;\nThe pretty birds would oft come to attend thee,\nYet fly away for fear they should offend thee;\nThe little creatures in the burrough by\nWould come abroad to sport them in your eye,\nYet fearful of the bow in your fair hand.\n\nWould run away when you did make a stand.\n\nNow let me come unto that stately tree,\nWherein such goodly prospects you did see;\nThat oak that did in height his fellows pass,\nAs much as lofty trees, low growing grass,\nMuch like a comely cedar straight and tall,\nWhose beauteous stature far exceeded all.\n\nHow often did you visit this fair tree,\nWhich seeming joyful in receiving thee,\nWould like a palm tree spread his arms abroad,\nDesirous that you there should make abode;\nWhose fair green leaves much like a comely veil,\nDefended Phoebus when he would assail;\nWhose pleasing boughs did yield a cool fresh air,\nJoying his happiness when you were there.\n\nWhere being seated, you might plainly see\nHills, vales, and woods, as if on bended knee\nThey had appeared, your honor to salute,\nOr to prefer some strange unlooked-for suit;\nAll interlaced with brooks and crystal springs,\nA prospect fit to please the eyes of kings.\n\nAnd thirteen shires appeared all in your sight,\nEurope could not afford much more delight.\n\nWhat was there then but gave you all content,\nWhile you the time in meditation spent\nOf their Creator\u2019s power, which there you saw,\nIn all his creatures held a perfect law;\nAnd in their beauties did you plain descry\nHis beauty, wisdom, grace, love, majesty.\n\nIn these sweet woods how often did you walk,\nWith Christ and his Apostles there to talk;\nPlacing his holy Writ in some fair tree\nTo meditate what you therein did see.\n\nWith Moses you did mount his holy hill\nTo know his pleasure, and perform his will.\n\nWith lowly David you did often sing\nHis holy hymns to Heaven\u2019s eternal King.\n\nAnd in sweet music did your soul delight\nTo sound his praises, morning, noon, and night.\n\nWith blessed Joseph you did often feed\nYour pined brethren, when they stood in need.\n\nAnd that sweet Lady sprung from Clifford\u2019s race,\nOf noble Bedford\u2019s blood, fair stem of grace,\nTo honorable Dorset now espoused,\nIn whose fair breast true virtue then was housed,\nOh what delight did my weak spirits find\nIn those pure parts of her well fram\u00e8d mind.\n\nAnd yet it grieves me that I cannot be\nNear unto her, whose virtues did agree\nWith those fair ornaments of outward beauty,\nWhich did enforce from all both love and duty.\n\nUnconstant Fortune, thou art most to blame,\nWho casts us down into so low a frame\nWhere our great friends we cannot daily see,\nSo great a difference is there in degree.\n\nMany are placed in those orbs of state,\nPartners in honor, so ordained by Fate,\nNearer in show, yet farther off in love,\nIn which, the lowest always are above.\n\nBut whither am I carried in conceit,\nMy wit too weak to conster of the great.\n\nWhy not?\n\nalthough we are but born of earth,\nWe may behold the heavens, despising death;\nAnd loving heaven that is so far above,\nMay in the end vouchsafe us entire love.\n\nTherefore sweet memory do thou retain\nThose pleasures past, which will not turn again:\nRemember beauteous Dorset\u2019s former sports,\nSo far from being touched by ill reports,\nWherein myself did always bear a part,\nWhile reverend love presented my true heart.\n\nThose recreations let me bear in mind,\nWhich her sweet youth and noble thoughts did find,\nWhereof deprived, I evermore must grieve,\nHating blind Fortune, careless to relieve,\nAnd you sweet Cooke-ham, whom these ladies leave,\nI now must tell the grief you did conceive\nAt their departure, when they went away,\nHow everything retained a sad dismay.\n\nNay long before, when once an inkling came,\nMethought each thing did unto sorrow frame:\nThe trees that were so glorious in our view,\nForsook both flowers and fruit, when once they knew\nOf your depart, their very leaves did wither,\nChanging their colors as they grew together.\n\nBut when they saw this had no power to stay you,\nThey often wept, though, speechless, could not pray you,\nLetting their tears in your fair bosoms fall,\nAs if they said, Why will ye leave us all?\n\nThis being vain, they cast their leaves away\nHoping that pity would have made you stay:\nTheir frozen tops, like age\u2019s hoary hairs,\nShows their disasters, languishing in fears.\n\nA swarthy riveled rind all over spread,\nTheir dying bodies half alive, half dead.\n\nBut your occasions called you so away\nThat nothing there had power to make you stay.\n\nYet did I see a noble grateful mind\nRequiting each according to their kind,\nForgetting not to turn and take your leave\nOf these sad creatures, powerless to receive\nYour favor, when with grief you did depart,\nPlacing their former pleasures in your heart,\nGiving great charge to noble memory\nThere to preserve their love continually.\n\nBut specially the love of that fair tree,\nThat first and last you did vouchsafe to see,\nIn which it pleased you oft to take the air\nWith noble Dorset, then a virgin fair,\nWhere many a learned book was read and scanned,\nTo this fair tree, taking me by the hand,\nYou did repeat the pleasures which had passed,\nSeeming to grieve they could no longer last.\n\nAnd with a chaste, yet loving kiss took leave,\nOf which sweet kiss I did it soon bereave,\nScorning a senseless creature should possess\nSo rare a favor, so great happiness.\n\nNo other kiss it could receive from me,\nFor fear to give back what it took of thee,\nSo I ungrateful creature did deceive it\nOf that which you in love vouchsafed to leave it.\n\nAnd though it oft had given me much content,\nYet this great wrong I never could repent;\nBut of the happiest made it most forlorn,\nTo show that nothing\u2019s free from Fortune\u2019s scorne,\nWhile all the rest with this most beauteous tree\nMade their sad consort sorrow\u2019s harmony.\n\nThe flowers that on the banks and walks did grow,\nCrept in the ground, the grass did weep for woe.\n\nThe winds and waters seemed to chide together\nBecause you went away they knew not whither;\nAnd those sweet brooks that ran so fair and clear,\nWith grief and trouble wrinkled did appear.\n\nThose pretty birds that wonted were to sing,\nNow neither sing, nor chirp, nor use their wing,\nBut with their tender feet on some bare spray,\nWarble forth sorrow, and their own dismay.\n\nFair Philomela leaves her mournful ditty,\nDrowned in deep sleep, yet can procure no pity.\n\nEach arbor, bank, each seat, each stately tree\nLooks bare and desolate now for want of thee,\nTurning green tresses into frosty gray,\nWhile in cold grief they wither all away.\n\nThe sun grew weak, his beams no comfort gave,\nWhile all green things did make the earth their grave.\n\nEach brier, each bramble, when you went away\nCaught fast your clothes, thinking to make you stay;\nDelightful Echo wonted to reply\nTo our last words, did now for sorrow die;\nThe house cast off each garment that might grace it,\nPutting on dust and cobwebs to deface it.\n\nAll desolation then there did appear,\nWhen you were going whom they held so dear.\n\nThis last farewell to Cooke-ham here I give,\nWhen I am dead thy name in this may live,\nWherein I have performed her noble hest\nWhose virtues lodge in my unworthy breast,\nAnd ever shall, so long as life remains,\nTying my life to her by those rich chains.", "period": "Jacobean", "literary_movement": "Renaissance", "register": "Elegiac",

withalle;\nShe leet no morsel from hir lippes falle,\nNe wette hir fyngres in hir sauce depe.\n\nWel koude she carie a morsel, and wel kepe\nThat no drope ne fille upon hir brist.\n\nIn curteisie was set ful muche hir list;\nHire over-lippe wyped she so clene,\nThat in hir coppe ther was no ferthyng sene\nOf grece, whan she dronken hadde hir draughte.\n\nFul semely after hir mete she raughte;\nAnd sikerly, she was of greet desport,\nAnd ful plesaunt, and amyable of port,\nAnd peyned hir to countrefete cheere\nOf court, and been estatlich of manere,\nAnd to ben holden digne of reverence.\n\nBut for to speken of hir conscience,\nShe was so charitable and so pitous,\nShe wolde wepe, if that she saugh a mous\nKaught in a trappe, if it were deed or bledde.\n\nOf smale houndes hadde she, that she fedde\nWith rosted flessh, or milk and wastel-breed.\n\nBut soore weep she if oon of hem were deed,\nOr if men smoot it with a yerde smerte;\nAnd al was conscience, and tendre herte.\n\nFul semyly hir wympul pynched was,\nHire nose tretys, hir eyen greye as glas,\nHir mouth ful smal, and therto softe and reed;\nBut sikerly, she hadde a fair forheed,\nIt was almoost a spanne brood, I trowe,\nFor, hardily, she was nat undergrowe.\n\nFul fetys was hir cloke, as I was war;\nOf smal coral aboute hir arm she bar\nA peire of bedes, gauded al with grene,\nAn theron heng a brooch of gold ful sheene,\nOn which ther was first write a crowned `A,'\nAnd after,`Amor vincit omnia.\n\nAnother Nonne with hir hadde she,\nThat was hire Chapeleyne, and preestes thre.\n\nA Monk ther was, a fair for the maistrie,\nAn outridere, that lovede venerie,\nA manly man, to been an abbot able.\n\nFul many a deyntee hors hadde he in stable;\nAnd whan he rood, men myghte his brydel heere\nGynglen in a whistlynge wynd als cleere,\nAnd eek as loude, as dooth the chapel belle,\nTher as this lord was keper of the celle.\n\nThe reule of Seint Maure, or of Seint Beneit,\nBycause that it was old and somdel streit-\nThis ilke Monk leet olde thynges pace,\nAnd heeld after the newe world the space.\n\nHe yaf nat of that text a pulled hen,\nThat seith that hunters beth nat hooly men,\nNe that a monk, whan he is recchelees,\nIs likned til a fissh that is waterlees-\nThis is to seyn, a monk out of his cloystre-\nBut thilke text heeld he nat worth an oystre!\nAnd I seyde his opinioun was good,\nWhat sholde he studie, and make hymselven wood,\nUpon a book in cloystre alwey to poure,\nOr swynken with his handes and laboure\nAs Austyn bit?\n\nHow shal the world be served?\n\nLat Austyn have his swynk to him reserved;\nTherfore he was a prikasour aright,\nGrehoundes he hadde, as swift as fowel in flight;\nOf prikyng and of huntyng for the hare\nWas al his lust, for no cost wolde he spare.\n\nI seigh his sleves ypurfiled at the hond\nWith grys, and that the fyneste of a lond;\nAnd for to festne his hood under his chyn\nHe hadde of gold ywroght a curious pyn;\nA love-knotte in the gretter ende ther was.\n\nHis heed was balled, that shoon as any glas,\nAnd eek his face, as it hadde been enoynt.\n\nHe was a lord ful fat and in good poynt,\nHise eyen stepe, and rollynge in his heed,\nThat stemed as a forneys of a leed;\nHis bootes souple, his hors in greet estaat;\nNow certeinly he was a fair prelaat!\nHe was nat pale as a forpyned goost,\nA fat swan loved he best of any roost.\n\nHis palfrey was as broun as is a berye,\nA Frere ther was, a wantowne and a merye,\nA lymytour, a ful solempne man,\nIn alle the ordres foure is noon that kan\nSo muchel of daliaunce and fair langage.\n\nHe hadde maad ful many a mariage\nOf yonge wommen at his owene cost.\n\nUnto his ordre he was a noble post,\nAnd wel biloved and famulier was he\nWith frankeleyns overal in his contree\nAnd eek with worthy wommen of the toun,\nFor he hadde power of confessioun,\nAs seyde hymself, moore than a curat,\nFor of his ordre he was licenciat.\n\nFul swetely herde he confessioun,\nAnd plesaunt was his a absolucioun,\nHe was an esy man to yeve penaunce\nTher as he wiste to have a good pitaunce;\nFor unto a povre ordre for to yive\nIs signe that a man is wel yshryve;\nFor, if he yaf, he dorste make avaunt,\nHe wiste that a man was repentaunt.\n\nFor many a man so harde is of his herte,\nHe may nat wepe, al thogh hym soore smerte;\nTherfore, in stede of wepynge and preyeres,\nMen moote yeve silver to the povre freres.\n\nHis typet was ay farsed ful of knyves\nAnd pynnes, for to yeven yonge wyves.\n\nAnd certeinly he hadde a murye note,\nWel koude he synge, and pleyen on a rote,\nOf yeddynges he baar outrely the pris.\n\nHis nekke whit was as the flour delys;\nTherto he strong was as a champioun,\nHe knew the tavernes wel in every toun\nAnd everich hostiler and tappestere\nBet than a lazar or a beggestere.\n\nFor unto swich a worthy man as he\nAcorded nat, as by his facultee,\nTo have with sike lazars aqueyntaunce;\nIt is nat honeste, it may nat avaunce,\nFor to deelen with no swich poraille,\nBut al with riche and selleres of vitaille;\nAnd overal, ther as profit sholde arise,\nCurteis he was, and lowely of servyse.\n\nTher nas no man nowher so vertuous;\nHe was the beste beggere in his hous,\n(And yaf a certeyn ferme for the graunt\nNoon of his brethren cam ther in his haunt\nFor thogh a wydwe hadde noght a sho,\nSo plesaunt was his `In principio'\nYet wolde he have a ferthyng er he wente;\nHis purchas was wel bettre than his rente.\n\nAnd rage he koude, as it were right a whelpe;\nIn love-dayes ther koude he muchel helpe;\nFor there he was nat lyk a cloysterer,\nWith a thredbare cope, as is a povre scoler,\nBut he was lyk a maister or a pope;\nOf double worstede was his semycope,\nThat rounded as a belle out of the presse.\n\nSomwhat he lipsed for his wantownesse\nTo make his Englissh sweete upon his tonge,\nAnd in his harpyng, whan that he hadde songe,\nHise eyen twynkled in his heed aryght\nAs doon the sterres in the frosty nyght.\n\nThis worthy lymytour was cleped Huberd.\n\nA Marchant was ther, with a forkek berd,\nIn mottelee, and hye on horse he sat,\nUpon his heed a Flaundryssh bevere hat,\nHis bootes clasped faire and fetisly.\n\nHise resons he spak ful solempnely,\nSownynge alway thencrees of his wynnyng.\n\nHe wolde the see were kept for any thyng\nBitwixe Middelburgh and Orewelle.\n\nWel koude he in eschaunge sheeldes selle.\n\nThis worthy man ful wel his wit bisette;\nTher wiste no wight that he was in dette,\nSo estatly was he of his governaunce,\nWith his bargaynes and with his chevyssaunce.\n\nForsothe, he was a worthy man with-alle,\nBut, sooth to seyn, I noot how men hym calle.\n\nA Clerk ther was of Oxenford also,\nThat unto logyk hadde longe ygo.\n\nAs leene was his hors as is a rake,\nAnd he nas nat right fat, I undertake,\nBut looked holwe and therto sobrely.\n\nFul thredbare was his overeste courtepy,\nFor he hadde geten hym yet no benefice,\nNe was so worldly for to have office,\nFor hym was levere have at his beddes heed\nTwenty bookes, clad in blak or reed,\nOf Aristotle and his plilosophie,\nThan robes riche, or fithele, or gay sautrie.\n\nBut al be that he was a philosophre,\nYet hadde he but litel gold in cofre;\nBut al that he myghte of his freendes hente,\nOn bookes and his lernynge he it spente,\nAnd bisily gan for the soules preye\nOf hem that yaf hym wherwith to scoleye.\n\nOf studie took he moost cure and moost heede,\nNoght o word spak he moore than was neede,\nAnd that was seyd in forme and reverence,\nAnd short and quyk, and ful of hy sentence.\n\nSownynge in moral vertu was his speche,\nAnd gladly wolde he lerne, and gladly teche.\n\nA Sergeant of the Lawe, war and wys,\nThat often hadde been at the parvys,\nTher was also, ful riche of excellence.\n\nDiscreet he was, and of greet reverence,-\nHe semed swich, hise wordes weren so wise.\n\nJustice he was ful often in assise,\nBy patente, and by pleyn commissioun.\n\nFor his science, and for his heigh renoun,\nOf fees and robes hadde he many oon.\n\nSo greet a purchasour was nowher noon,\nAl was fee symple to hym in effect,\nHis purchasyng myghte nat been infect.\n\nNowher so bisy a man as he ther nas,\nAnd yet he semed bisier than he was;\nIn termes hadde he caas and doomes alle,\nThat from the tyme of Kyng William were falle.\n\nTherto he koude endite, and make a thyng,\nTher koude no wight pynche at his writyng.\n\nAnd every statut koude he pleyn by rote.\n\nHe rood but hoomly in a medlee cote\nGirt with a ceint of silk, with barres smale;-\nOf his array telle I no lenger tale.\n\nA Frankeleyn was in his compaignye;\nWhit was his berd as is a dayesye.\n\nOf his complexioun he was sangwyn.\n\nWel loved he by the morwe a sope in wyn,\nTo lyven in delit was evere his wone;\nFor he was Epicurus owene sone,\nThat heeld opinioun that pleyn delit\nWas verraily felicitee parfit,\nAn housholdere, and that a greet, was he;\nSeint Julian was he in his contree.\n\nHis breed, his ale, was alweys after oon,\nA bettre envyned man was nowher noon.\n\nWithoute bake mete was nevere his hous,\nOf fissh and flessh, and that so plentevous,\nIt snewed in his hous of mete and drynke,\nOf alle deyntees that men koude thynke.\n\nAfter the sondry sesons of the yeer\nSo chaunged he his mete and his soper.\n\nFul many a fat partrich hadde he in muwe,\nAnd many a breem and many a luce in stuwe.\n\nWo was his cook, but if his sauce were\nPoynaunt, and sharp, and redy al his geere.\n\nHis table dormant in his halle alway\nStood redy covered al the longe day.\n\nAt sessiouns ther was he lord and sire;\nFul ofte tyme he was knyght of the shire.\n\nAn anlaas and a gipser al of silk\nHeeng at his girdel, whit as morne milk.\n\nA shirreve hadde he been, and a countour,\nWas nowher swich a worthy vavasour.\n\nAn Haberdasshere and a Carpenter,\nA Webbe, a Dyere, and a Tapycer-\nAnd they were clothed alle in o lyveree\nOf a solempne and a greet fraternitee.\n\nFul fressh and newe hir geere apiked was,\nHir knyves were chaped noght with bras,\nBut al with silver wroght ful clene and weel,\nHir girdles and hir pouches everydeel.\n\nWel semed ech of hem a fair burgeys\nTo sitten in a yeldehalle on a deys.\n\nEverich for the wisdom that he kan\nWas shaply for to been an alderman;\nFor catel hadde they ynogh, and rente,\nAnd eek hir wyves wolde it wel assente-\nAnd eles, certeyn, were they to blame!\nIt is ful fair to been ycleped `ma Dame,'\nAnd goon to vigilies al bifore,\nAnd have a mantel roialliche ybore.\n\nA Cook they hadde with hem for the nones,\nTo boille the chiknes with the marybones,\nAnd poudre-marchant tart, and galyngale.\n\nWel koude he knowe a draughte of London ale;\nHe koude rooste, and sethe, and broille, and frye,\nMaken mortreux, and wel bake a pye.\n\nBut greet harm was it, as it thoughte me,\nThat on his shyne a mormal hadde he!\nFor blankmanger, that made he with the beste.\n\nA Shipman was ther, wonynge fer by weste;\nFor aught I woot, he was of Dertemouthe.\n\nHe rood upon a rouncy, as he kouthe,\nIn a gowne of faldyng to the knee.\n\nA daggere hangynge on a laas hadde he\nAboute his nekke, under his arm adoun.\n\nThe hoote somer hadde maad his hewe al broun,\nAnd certeinly he was a good felawe.\n\nFul many a draughte of wyn had he ydrawe\nFro Burdeuxward, whil that the chapman sleep.\n\nOf nyce conscience took he no keep;\nIf that he faught, and hadde the hyer hond,\nBy water he sente hem hoom to every lond.\n\nBut of his craft, to rekene wel his tydes,\nHis stremes, and his daungers hym bisides,\nHis herberwe and his moone, his lodemenage,\nTher nas noon swich from Hulle to Cartage.\n\nHardy he was, and wys to undertake,\nWith many a tempest hadde his berd been shake;\nHe knew alle the havenes as they were\nFrom Gootlond to the Cape of Fynystere,\nAnd every cryke in Britaigne and in Spayne.\n\nHis barge yeleped was the Maudelayne.\n\nWith us ther was a Doctour of Phisik;\nIn al this world ne was ther noon hym lik,\nTo speke of phisik and of surgerye;\nFor he was grounded in astronomye.\n\nHe kepte his pacient a ful greet deel\nIn houres, by his magyk natureel.\n\nWel koude he fortunen the ascendent\nOf hisc ymages for his pacient.\n\nHe knew the cause of everich maladye,\nWere it of hoot or coold, or moyste, or drye,\nAnd where they engendred, and of what humour.\n\nHe was a verray parfit praktisour;\nThe cause yknowe, and of his harm the roote,\nAnon he yaf the sike man his boote.\n\nFul redy hadde he hise apothecaries\nTo sende him drogges and his letuaries,\nFor ech of hem made oother for to wynne,\nHir frendshipe nas nat newe to bigynne.\n\nWel knew he the olde Esculapius,\nAnd Deyscorides and eek Rufus,\nOlde Ypocras, Haly, and Galyen,\nSerapioun, Razis, and Avycen,\nAverrois, Damascien, and Constantyn,\nBernard, and Gatesden, and Gilbertyn.\n\nOf his diete mesurable was he,\nFor it was of no superfluitee,\nBut of greet norissyng, and digestible.\n\nHis studie was but litel on the Bible.\n\nIn sangwyn and in pers he clad was al,\nLyned with taffata and with sendal-\nAnd yet he was but esy of dispence;\nHe kepte that he wan in pestilence.\n\nFor gold in phisik is a cordial,\nTherfore he lovede gold in special.\n\nA good wif was ther, of biside Bathe,\nHe was to synful man nat despitous,\nNe of his speche daungerous ne digne,\nBut in his techyng discreet and benygne;\nTo drawen folk to hevene by fairnesse,\nBy good ensample, this was his bisynesse.\n\nBut it were any persone obstinat,\nWhat so he were, of heigh or lough estat,\nHym wolde he snybben sharply for the nonys.\n\nA bettre preest, I trowe, that nowher noon ys.\n\nHe waited after no pompe and reverence,\nNe maked him a spiced conscience,\nBut Cristes loore, and Hise apostles twelve\nHe taughte, but first he folwed it hym-selve.\n\nWith hym ther was a Plowman, was his brother,\nThat hadde ylad of dong ful many a fother.\n\nA trewe swybnker and a good was he,\nLyvynge in pees and parfit charitee.\n\nGod loved he best with al his hoole herte\nAt alle tymes, thogh him gamed or smerte,\nAnd thanne his neighebore right as hym-selve;\nHe wolde thresshe, and therto dyke and delve,\nFor Cristes sake, for every povre wight\nWithouten hire, if it lay in his myght.\n\nHise tithes payed he ful faire and wel,\nBothe of his propre swynk and his catel.\n\nIn a tabard he rood, upon a mere.\n\nTher was also a Reve and a Millere,\nA Somnour and a Pardoner also,\nA Maunciple, and myself, ther were namo.\n\nThe Millere was a stout carl for the nones,\nFul byg he was of brawn and eek of bones-\nThat proved wel, for overal ther he cam\nAt wrastlyng he wolde have alwey the ram.\n\nHe was short-sholdred, brood, a thikke knarre,\nTher was no dore that he nolde heve of harre,\nOr breke it at a rennyng with his heed.\n\nHis berd as any sowe or fox was reed,\nAnd therto brood, as though it were a spade.\n\nUpon the cop right of his nose he hade\nA werte, and thereon stood a toft of heres\nReed as the brustles of a sowes eres;\nHise nosethirles blake were and wyde.\n\nA swerd and bokeler bar he by his syde.\n\nHis mouth as greet was as a greet forneys,\nHe was a janglere and a goliardeys,\nAnd that was moost of synne and harlotries.\n\nWel koude he stelen corn, and tollen thries,\nAnd yet he hadde a thombe of gold, pardee.\n\nA whit cote and a blew hood wered he.\n\nA baggepipe wel koude he blowe and sowne,\nAnd therwithal he broghte us out of towne.\n\nA gentil Maunciple was ther of a temple,\nOf which achatours myghte take exemple\nFor to be wise in byynge of vitaille;\nFor wheither that he payde or took by taille,\nAlgate he wayted so in his achaat\nThat he was ay biforn, and in good staat.\n\nNow is nat that of God a ful fair grace,\nThat swich a lewed mannes wit shal pace\nThe wisdom of an heep of lerned men?\n\nOf maistres hadde he mo than thries ten,\nThat weren of lawe expert and curious,\nOf whiche ther weren a duszeyne in that hous\nWorthy to been stywardes of rente and lond\nOf any lord that is in Engelond,\nTo maken hym lyve by his propre good,\nIn honour dettelees, but if he were wood;\nOr lyve as scarsly as hym list desire,\nAnd able for to helpen al a shire\nIn any caas that myghte falle or happe-\nAnd yet this manciple sette hir aller cappe!\nThe Reve was a sclendre colerik man;\nHis berd was shave as ny as ever he kan,\nHis heer was by his erys ful round yshorn,\nHis top was dokked lyk a preest biforn.\n\nFul longe were his legges, and ful lene,\nYlyk a staf, ther was no calf ysene.\n\nWel koude he kepe a gerner and a bynne,\nTher was noon auditour koude on him wynne.\n\nWel wiste he, by the droghte, and by the reyn,\nThe yeldynge of his seed and of his greyn.\n\nHis lordes sheep, his neet, his dayerye,\nHis swyn, his hors, his stoor, and his pultrye,\nWas hooly in this reves governyng\nAnd by his covenant yaf the rekenyng,\nSyn that his lord was twenty yeer of age;\nTher koude no man brynge hym in arrerage.\n\nTher nas baillif, ne hierde, nor oother hyne,\nThat he ne knew his sleighte and his covyne,\nThey were adrad of hym as of the deeth.\n\nHis wonyng was ful faire upon an heeth,\nWith grene trees shadwed was his place.\n\nHe koude bettre than his lord purchace.\n\nFul riche he was astored pryvely;\nHis lord wel koude he plesen subtilly\nTo yeve and lene hym of his owene good,\nAnd have a thank, and yet a cote and hook.\n\nIn youthe he hadde lerned a good myster,\nHe was a wel good wrighte, a carpenter.\n\nThis reve sat upon a ful good stot,\nThat was al pomely grey, and highte Scot.\n\nA long surcote of pers upon he hade,\nAnd by his syde he baar a rusty blade.\n\nOf Northfolk was this reve, of which I telle,\nBisyde a toun men clepen Baldeswelle.\n\nTukked he was, as is a frere, aboute,\nAnd evere he rood the hyndreste of oure route.\n\nA Somonour was ther with us in that place,\nThat hadde a fyr-reed cherubynnes face,\nFor sawcefleem he was, with eyen narwe.\n\nAs hoot he was, and lecherous, as a sparwe,\nWith scalled browes blake, and piled berd,\nOf his visage children were aferd.\n\nTher nas quyk-silver, lytarge, ne brymstoon,\nBoras, ceruce, ne oille of tartre noon,\nNe oynement, that wolde clense and byte,\nThat hym myghte helpen of his wheldes white,\nNor of the knobbes sittynge on his chekes.\n\nWel loved he garleek, oynons, and eek lekes,\nAnd for to drynken strong wyn, reed as blood;\nThanne wolde he speke and crie as he were wood.\n\nAnd whan that he wel dronken hadde the wyn,\nThan wolde he speke no word but Latyn.\n\nA fewe termes hadde he, two or thre,\nThat he had lerned out of som decree-\nNo wonder is, he herde it al the day,\nAnd eek ye knowen wel how that a jay\nKan clepen `watte' as wel as kan the Pope.\n\nBut who so koude in oother thyng hym grope,\nThanne hadde he spent al his plilosophie;\nAy `questio quid juris' wolde he crie.\n\nHe was a gentil harlot and a kynde,\nA bettre felawe sholde men noght fynde;\nHe wolde suffre, for a quart of wyn,\nA good felawe to have his concubyn\nA twelf-monthe, and excuse hym atte fulle-\nFul prively a fynch eek koude he pulle.\n\nAnd if he foond owher a good felawe,\nHe wolde techen him to have noon awe,\nIn swich caas, of the erchedekeness curs,\nBut if a mannes soule were in his purs;\nFor in his purs he sholde ypunysshed be,\n`Purs is the erchedekenes helle,' seyde he.\n\nBut wel I woot he lyed right in dede;\nOf cursyng oghte ech gilty man him drede-\nFor curs wol slee, right as assoillyng savith-\nAnd also war him of a Significavit.\n\nIn daunger hadde he at his owene gise\nThe yonge girles of the diocise,\nAnd knew hir conseil, and was al hir reed.\n\nA gerland hadde he set upon his heed\nAs greet as it were for an ale-stake;\nA bokeleer hadde he maad him of a cake.\n\nWith hym ther rood a gentil Pardoner\nOf Rouncivale, his freend and his compeer,\nThat streight was comen fro the court of Rome.\n\nFul loude he soong `com hider, love, to me.\n\nThis Somonour bar to hym a stif burdoun,\nWas nevere trompe of half so greet a soun.\n\nThis Pardoner hadde heer as yelow as wex,\nBut smothe it heeng as dooth a strike of flex;\nBy ounces henge hise lokkes that he hadde,\nAnd therwith he hise shuldres overspradde;\nBut thynne it lay by colpons oon and oon.\n\nBut hood, for jolitee, wered he noon,\nFor it was trussed up in his walet.\n\nHym thoughte he rood al of the newe jet,\nDischevele, save his cappe, he rood al bare.\n\nSwiche glarynge eyen hadde he as an hare.\n\nA vernycle hadde he sowed upon his cappe.\n\nHis walet lay biforn hym in his lappe\nBret-ful of pardoun come from Rome al hoot.\n\nA voys he hadde as smal as hath a goot,\nNo berd hadde he, ne nevere sholde have,\nAs smothe it was as it were late shave,\nI trowe he were a geldyng or a mare.\n\nBut of his craft, fro Berwyk into Ware,\nNe was ther swich another Pardoner;\nFor in his male he hadde a pilwe-beer,\nWhich that he seyde was Oure Lady veyl;\nHe seyde, he hadde a gobet of the seyl\nThat Seinte Peter hadde, whan that he wente\nUpon the see, til Jesu Crist hym hente.\n\nHe hadde a croys of latoun, ful of stones,\nAnd in a glas he hadde pigges bones;\nBut with thise relikes whan that he fond\nA povre persoun dwellyng up-on-lond,\nUpon a day he gat hym moore moneye\nThan that the person gat in monthes tweye,\nAnd thus with feyned flaterye and japes\nHe made the persoun and the peple his apes.\n\nBut trewely to tellen atte laste,\nHe was in chirche a noble ecclesiaste;\nWel koude he rede a lessoun or a storie,\nBut alderbest he song an offertorie,\nFor wel he wiste, whan that song was songe\nHe moste preche, and wel affile his tonge;\nTo wynne silver, as he ful wel koude,\nTherfore he song the murierly and loude.\n\nNow have I toold you shortly in a clause\nThestaat, tharray, the nombre, and eek the cause\nWhy that assembled was this compaignye\nIn Southwerk, at this gentil hostelrye,\nThat highte the Tabard, faste by the Belle.\n\nBut now is tyme to yow for to telle\nHow that we baren us that ilke nyght\nWhan we were in that hostelrie alyght,\nAnd after wol I telle of our viage,\nAnd all the remenaunt of oure pilgrimage.\n\nBut first I pray yow, of youre curteisye,\nThat ye narette it nat my vileynye,\nThogh that I pleynly speke in this mateere\nTo telle yow hir wordes and hir cheere,\nNe thogh I speke hir wordes proprely.\n\nFor this ye knowen also wel as I,\nWho-so shal telle a tale after a man,\nHe moot reherce as ny as evere he kan\nEverich a word, if it be in his charge,\nAl speke he never so rudeliche or large;\nOr ellis he moot telle his tale untrewe,\nOr feyne thyng, or fynde wordes newe.\n\nHe may nat spare, al thogh he were his brother,\nHe moot as wel seye o word as another.\n\nCrist spak hym-self ful brode in Hooly Writ,\nAnd, wel ye woot, no vileynye is it.\n\nEek Plato seith, who so kan hym rede,\nThe wordes moote be cosyn to the dede.\n\nAlso I prey yow to foryeve it me,\nAl have I nat set folk in hir degree\nHeere in this tale, as that they sholde stonde-\nMy wit is short, ye may wel understonde.\n\nGreet chiere made oure hoost us everichon,\nAnd to the soper sette he us'anon.\n\nHe served us with vitaille at the beste;\nStrong was the wyn, and wel to drynke us lestel\nA semely man oure Hooste was withalle\nFor to been a marchal in an halle.\n\nA large man he was, with eyen stepe,\nA fairer burgeys was ther noon in Chepe;\nBoold of his speche, and wys, and well ytaught,\nAnd of manhod hym lakkede right naught.\n\nEek therto he was right a myrie man;\nAnd after soper pleyen he bigan,\nAnd spak of myrthe amonges othere thynges,\nWhan that we hadde maad our rekenynges,\nAnd seyde thus: \"Now lordynges, trewely,\nYe been to me right welcome hertely,\nFor by my trouthe, if that I shal nat lye,\nI saugh nat this yeer so

descent from Royall lynage came\nOf ancient Kings and Queenes, that had of yore\nTheir scepters stretcht from East to Westerne shore,\nAnd all the world in their subiection held;\nTill that infernall feend with foule vprore\nForwasted all their land, and them expeld:\nWhom to auenge, she had this Knight from far co\nm\npeld.\n\nBehind her farre away a Dwarfe did lag,\nThat lasie seemd in being euer last,\nOr wearied with bearing of her bag\nOf needments at his backe.\n\nThus as they past,\nThe day with cloudes was suddeine ouercast,\nAnd angry Ioue an hideous storme of raine\nDid poure into his Lemans lap so fast,\nThat euery wight to shrowd it did constrain,\nAnd this faire couple eke to shroud the\nm\nselues were fain.\n\nEnforst to seeke some couert nigh at hand,\nA shadie groue not far away they spide,\nThat promist ayde the tempest to withstand:\nWhose loftie trees yclad with sommers pride,\nDid spred so broad, that heauens light did hide,\nNot perceable with power of any starre:\nAnd all within were pathes and alleies wide,\nWith footing worne, and leading inward farre:\nFaire harbour that them seemes; so in they entred arre.\n\nAnd foorth they passe, with pleasure forward led,\nIoying to heare the birdes sweete harmony,\nWhich therein shrouded from the tempest dred,\nSeemd in their song to scorne the cruell sky.\n\nMuch can they prayse the trees so straight and hy,\nThe sayling Pine, the Cedar proud and tall,\nThe vine-prop Elme, the Poplar neuer dry,\nThe builder Oake, sole king of forrests all,\nThe Aspine good for staues, the Cypresse funerall.\n\nThe Laurell, meed of mightie Conquerours\nAnd Poets sage, the Firre that weepeth still,\nThe Willow worne of forlorne Paramours,\nThe Eugh obedient to the benders will,\nThe Birch for shaftes, the Sallow for the mill,\nThe Mirrhe sweete bleeding in the bitter wound,\nThe warlike Beech, the Ash for nothing ill,\nThe fruitfull Oliue, and the Platane round,\nThe caruer Holme, the Maple seeldom inward sound.\n\nLed with delight, they thus beguile the way,\nVntill the blustring storme is ouerblowne;\nWhen weening to returne, whence they did stray,\nThey cannot finde that path, which first was showne,\nBut wander too and fro in wayes vnknowne,\nFurthest from end then, when they neerest weene,\nThat makes them doubt, their wits be not their owne:\nSo many pathes, so many turnings seene,\nThat which of them to take, in diuerse doubt they been.\n\nAt last resoluing forward still to fare,\nTill that some end they finde or in or out,\nThat path they take, that beaten seemd most bare,\nAnd like to lead the labyrinth about;\nWhich when by tract they hunted had throughout,\nAt length it brought them to a hollow caue,\nAmid the thickest woods.\n\nThe Champion stout\nEftsoones dismounted from his courser braue,\nAnd to the Dwarfe a while his needlesse spere he gaue.\n\nBe well aware, quoth then that Ladie milde,\nLeast suddaine mischiefe ye too rash prouoke:\nThe danger hid, the place vnknowne and wilde,\nBreedes dreadfull doubts: Oft fire is without smoke,\nAnd perill without show: therefore your stroke\nSir knight with-hold, till further triall made.\n\nAh Ladie (said he) shame were to reuoke\nThe forward footing for an hidden shade:\nVertue giues her selfe light, through darkenesse for to wade.\n\nYea but (quoth she) the perill of this place\nI better wot then you, though now too late\nTo wish you backe returne with foule disgrace,\nYet wisedome warnes, whilest foot is in the gate,\nTo stay the steppe, ere forced to retrate.\n\nThis is the wandring wood, this Errours den,\nA monster vile, whom God and man does hate:\nTherefore I read beware.\n\nFly fly (quoth then\nThe fearefull Dwarfe\nthis is no place for liuing men.\n\nBut full of fire and greedy hardiment,\nThe youthfull knight could not for ought be staide,\nBut forth vnto the darksome hole he went,\nAnd looked in: his glistring armor made\nA litle glooming light, much like a shade,\nBy which he saw the vgly monster plaine,\nHalfe like a serpent horribly displaide,\nBut th'other halfe did womans shape retaine,\nMost lothsom, filthie, foule, and full of vile disdaine.\n\nAnd as she lay vpon the durtie ground,\nHer huge long taile her den all ouerspred,\nYet was in knots and many boughtes vpwound,\nPointed with mortall sting.\n\nOf her there bred\nA thousand yong ones, which she dayly fed,\nSucking vpon her poisonous dugs, each one\nOf sundry shapes, yet all ill fauored:\nSoone as that vncouth light vpon them shone,\nInto her mouth they crept, and suddain all were gone.\n\nTheir dam vpstart, out of her den effraide,\nAnd rushed forth, hurling her hideous taile\nAbout her cursed head, whose folds displaid\nWere stretcht now forth at length without entraile.\n\nShe lookt about, and seeing one in mayle\nArmed to point, sought backe to turne againe;\nFor light she hated as the deadly bale,\nAy wont in desert darknesse to remaine,\nWhere plaine none might her see, nor she see any plaine.\n\nWhich when the valiant Elfe perceiu'd, he lept\nAs Lyon fierce vpon the flying pray,\nAnd with his trenchand blade her boldly kept\nFrom turning backe, and forced her to stay:\nTherewith enrag'd she loudly gan to bray,\nAnd turning fierce, her speckled taile aduaunst,\nThreatning her angry sting, him to dismay:\nWho nought aghast, his mightie hand enhaunst:\nThe stroke down fro\nm\n; her head vnto her shoulder glaunst.\n\nMuch daunted with that dint, her sence was dazd,\nYet kindling rage, her selfe she gathered round,\nAnd all attonce her beastly body raizd\nWith doubled forces high aboue the ground:\nTho wrapping vp her wrethed sterne arownd,\nLept fierce vpon his shield, and her huge traine\nAll suddenly about his body wound,\nThat hand or foot to stirre he stroue in vaine:\nGod helpe the man so wrapt in Errours endlesse traine.\n\nHis Lady sad to see his sore constraint,\nCride out, Now now Sir knight, shew what ye bee,\nAdd faith vnto your force, and be not faint:\nStrangle her, else she sure will strangle thee.\n\nThat when he heard, in great perplexitie,\nHis gall did grate for griefe and high disdaine,\nAnd knitting all his force got one hand free,\nWherewith he grypt her gorge with so great paine,\nThat soone to loose her wicked bands did her constraine.\n\nTherewith she spewd out of her filthy maw\nA floud of poyson horrible and blacke,\nFull of great lumpes of flesh and gobbets raw,\nWhich stunck so vildly, that it forst him slacke\nHis grasping hold, and from her turne him backe:\nHer vomit full of bookes and papers was,\nWith loathly frogs and toades, which eyes did lacke,\nAnd creeping sought way in the weedy gras:\nHer filthy parbreake all the place defiled has.\n\nAs when old father Nilus gins to swell\nWith timely pride aboue the Aegyptian vale,\nHis fattie waues do fertile slime outwell,\nAnd ouerflow each plaine and lowly dale:\nBut when his later spring gins to auale,\nHuge heapes of mudd he leaues, wherein there breed\nTen thousand kindes of creatures, partly male\nAnd partly female of his fruitfull seed;\nSuch vgly monstrous shapes elswhere may no man reed.\n\nThe same so sore annoyed has the knight,\nThat welnigh choked with the deadly stinke,\nHis forces faile, ne can no longer fight.\n\nWhose corage when the feend perceiu'd to shrinke,\nShe poured forth out of her hellish sinke\nHer fruitfull cursed spawne of serpents small,\nDeformed monsters, fowle, and blacke as inke,\nWhich swarming all about his legs did crall,\nAnd him encombred sore, but could not hurt at all.\n\nAs gentle Shepheard in sweete euen-tide,\nWhen ruddy Phoebus gins to welke in west,\nHigh on an hill, his flocke to vewen wide,\nMarkes which do byte their hasty supper best;\nA cloud of combrous gnattes do him molest,\nAll striuing to infixe their feeble stings,\nThat from their noyance he no where can rest,\nBut with his clownish hands their tender wings\nHe brusheth oft, and oft doth mar their murmurings.\n\nThus ill bestedd, and fearefull more of shame,\nThen of the certaine perill he stood in,\nHalfe furious vnto his foe he came,\nResolv'd in minde all suddenly to win,\nOr soone to lose, before he once would lin;\nAnd strooke at her with more then manly force,\nThat from her body full of filthie sin\nHe raft her hatefull head without remorse;\nA streame of cole black bloud forth gushed fro\nm\n; her corse.\n\nHer scattred brood, soone as their Parent deare\nThey saw so rudely falling to the ground,\nGroning full deadly, all with troublous feare,\nGathred themselues about her body round,\nWeening their wonted entrance to haue found\nAt her wide mouth: but being there withstood\nThey flocked all about her bleeding wound,\nAnd sucked vp their dying mothers blood,\nMaking her death their life, and eke her hurt their good.\n\nThat detestable sight him much amazde,\nTo see th'vnkindly Impes of heauen accurst,\nDeuoure their dam; on whom while so he gazd,\nHauing all satisfide their bloudy thurst,\nTheir bellies swolne he saw with fulnesse burst,\nAnd bowels gushing forth: well worthy end\nOf such as drunke her life, the which them nurst;\nNow needeth him no lenger labour spend,\nHis foes haue slaine themselues, with whom he should contend.\n\nHis Ladie seeing all, that chaunst, from farre\nApprocht in hast to greet his victorie,\nAnd said, Faire knight, borne vnder happy starre,\nWho see your vanquisht foes before you lye:\nWell worthy be you of that Armorie,\nWherein ye haue great glory wonne this day,\nAnd proou'd your strength on a strong enimie,\nYour first aduenture: many such I pray,\nAnd henceforth euer wish, that like succeed it may.\n\nThen mounted he vpon his Steede againe,\nAnd with the Lady backward sought to wend;\nThat path he kept, which beaten was most plaine,\nNe euer would to any by-way bend,\nBut still did follow one vnto the end,\nThe which at last out of the wood them brought.\n\nSo forward on his way (with God to frend)\nHe passed forth, and new aduenture sought;\nLong way he trauelled, before he heard of ought.\n\nAt length they chaunst to meet vpon the way\nAn aged Sire, in long blacke weedes yclad,\nHis feete all bare, his beard all hoarie gray,\nAnd by his belt his booke he hanging had;\nSober he seemde, and very sagely sad,\nAnd to the ground his eyes were lowly bent,\nSimple in shew, and voyde of malice bad,\nAnd all the way he prayed, as he went,\nAnd often knockt his brest, as one that did repent.\n\nHe faire the knight saluted, louting low,\nWho faire him quited, as that courteous was:\nAnd after asked him, if he did know\nOf straunge aduentures, which abroad did pas.\n\nAh my deare Sonne (quoth he) how should, alas,\nSilly old man, that liues in hidden cell,\nBidding his beades all day for his trespas,\nTydings of warre and worldly trouble tell?\n\nWith holy father sits not with such things to mell.\n\nBut if of daunger which hereby doth dwell,\nAnd homebred euill ye desire to heare,\nOf a straunge man I can you tidings tell,\nThat wasteth all this countrey farre and neare.\n\nOf such (said he) I chiefly do inquere,\nAnd shall you well reward to shew the place,\nIn which that wicked wight his dayes doth weare:\nFor to all knighthood it is foule disgrace,\nThat such a cursed creature liues so long a space.\n\nFar hence (quoth he) in wastfull wildernesse\nHis dwelling is, by which no liuing wight\nMay euer passe, but thorough great distresse.\n\nNow (sayd the Lady) draweth toward night,\nAnd well I wote, that of your later fight\nYe all forwearied be: for what so strong,\nBut wanting rest will also want of might?\n\nThe Sunne that measures heauen all day long,\nAt night doth baite his steedes the Ocean waues emong.\n\nThen with the Sunne take Sir, your timely rest,\nAnd with new day new worke at once begin:\nVntroubled night they say giues counsell best.\n\nRight well Sir knight ye haue aduised bin,\n(Quoth then that aged man\nthe way to win\nIs wisely to aduise: now day is spent;\nTherefore with me ye may take vp your In\nFor this same night.\n\nThe knight was well content:\nSo with that godly father to his home they went.\n\nA little lowly Hermitage it was,\nDowne in a dale, hard by a forests side,\nFar from resort of people, that did pas\nIn trauell to and froe: a little wyde\nThere was an holy Chappell edifyde,\nWherein the Hermite dewly wont to say\nHis holy things each morne and euentyde:\nThereby a Christall streame did gently play,\nWhich from a sacred fountaine welled forth alway.\n\nArriued there, the little house they fill,\nNe looke for entertainement, where none was:\nRest is their feast, and all things at their will;\nThe noblest mind the best contentment has.\n\nWith faire discourse the euening so they pas:\nFor that old man of pleasing wordes had store,\nAnd well could file his tongue as smooth as glas;\nHe told of Saintes and Popes, and euermore\nHe strowd an Aue-Mary after and before.\n\nThe drouping Night thus creepeth on them fast,\nAnd the sad humour loading their eye liddes,\nAs messenger of Morpheus on them cast\nSweet slo\nm\nbring deaw, the which to sleepe them biddes.\n\nVnto their lodgings then his guestes he riddes:\nWhere when all drownd in deadly sleepe he findes,\nHe to his study goes, and there amiddes\nHis Magick bookes and artes of sundry kindes,\nHe seekes out mighty charmes, to trouble sleepy mindes\nThen choosing out few wordes most horrible,\n(Let none them read) thereof did verses frame,\nWith which and other spelles like terrible,\nHe bad awake blacke Plutoes griesly Dame,\nAnd cursed heauen, and spake reprochfull shame\nOf highest God, the Lord of life and light;\nA bold bad man, that dar'd to call by name\nGreat Gorgon, Prince of darknesse and dead night,\nAt which Cocytus quakes, and Styx is put to flight.\n\nAnd forth he cald out of deepe darknesse dred\nLegions of Sprights, the which like little flyes\nFluttring about his euer damned hed,\nA-waite whereto their seruice he applyes,\nTo aide his friends, or fray his enimies:\nOf those he chose out two, the falsest twoo,\nAnd fittest for to forge true-seeming lyes;\nThe one of them he gaue a message too,\nThe other by him selfe staide other worke to doo.\n\nHe making speedy way through spersed ayre,\nAnd through the world of waters wide and deepe,\nTo Morpheus house doth hastily repaire.\n\nAmid the bowels of the earth full steepe,\nAnd low, where dawning day doth neuer peepe,\nHis dwelling is; there Tethys his wet bed\nDoth euer wash, and Cynthia still doth steepe\nIn siluer deaw his euer-drouping hed,\nWhiles sad Night ouer him her ma\nn\ntle black doth spred\nWhose double gates he findeth locked fast,\nThe one faire fram'd of burnisht Yuory,\nThe other all with siluer ouercast;\nAnd wakefull dogges before them farre do lye,\nWatching to banish Care their enimy,\nWho oft is wont to trouble gentle Sleepe.\n\nBy them the Sprite doth passe in quietly,\nAnd vnto Morpheus comes, whom drowned deepe\nIn drowsie fit he findes: of nothing he takes keepe.\n\nAnd more, to lulle him in his slumber soft,\nA trickling streame from high rocke tumbling downe\nAnd euer-drizling raine vpon the loft,\nMixt with a murmuring winde, much like the sowne\nOf swarming Bees, did cast him in a swowne:\nNo other noyse, nor peoples troublous cryes,\nAs still are wont t'annoy the walled towne,\nMight there be heard: but carelesse Quiet lyes,\nWrapt in eternall silence farre from enemyes.\n\nThe messenger approching to him spake,\nBut his wast wordes returnd to him in vaine:\nSo sound he slept, that nought mought him awake.\n\nThen rudely he him thrust, and pusht with paine,\nWhereat he gan to stretch: but he againe\nShooke him so hard, that forced him to speake.\n\nAs one then in a dreame, whose dryer braine\nIs tost with troubled sights and fancies weake,\nHe mumbled soft, but would not all his silence breake.\n\nThe Sprite then gan more boldly him to wake,\nAnd threatned vnto him the dreaded name\nOf Hecate: whereat he gan to quake,\nAnd lifting vp his lompish head, with blame\nHalfe angry asked him, for what he came.\n\nHither (quoth he) me Archimago sent,\nHe that the stubborne Sprites can wisely tame,\nHe bids thee to him send for his intent\nA fit false dreame, that can delude the sleepers sent.\n\nThe God obayde, and calling forth straight way\nA diuerse dreame out of his prison darke,\nDeliuered it to him, and downe did lay\nHis heauie head, deuoide of carefull carke,\nWhose sences all were straight benumbd and starke.\n\nHe backe returning by the Yuorie dore,\nRemounted vp as light as chearefull Larke,\nAnd on his litle winges the dreame he bore\nIn hast vnto his Lord, where he him left afore.\n\nWho all this while with charmes and hidden artes,\nHad made a Lady of that other Spright,\nAnd fram'd of liquid ayre her tender partes\nSo liuely, and so like in all mens sight,\nThat weaker sence it could haue rauisht quight:\nThe maker selfe for all his wondrous witt,\nWas nigh beguiled with so goodly sight:\nHer all in white he clad, and ouer it\nCast a blacke stole, most like to seeme for Vna fit.\n\nNow when that ydle dreame was to him brought,\nVnto that Elfin knight he bad him fly,\nWhere he slept soundly void of euill thought,\nAnd with false shewes abuse his fantasy,\nIn sort as he him schooled priuily:\nAnd that new creature borne without her dew,\nFull of the makers guile, with vsage sly\nHe taught to imitate that Lady trew,\nWhose semblance she did carrie vnder feigned hew.\n\nThus well instructed, to their worke they hast,\nAnd comming where the knight in slomber lay,\nThe one vpon his hardy head him plast,\nAnd made him dreame of loues and lustfull play,\nThat nigh his manly hart did melt away,\nBathed in wanton blis and wicked ioy:\nThen seemed him his Lady by him lay,\nAnd to him playnd, how that false winged boy,\nHer chast hart had subdewd, to learne Dame pleasures toy.\n\nAnd she her selfe of beautie soueraigne Queene,\nFaire Venus seemde vnto his bed to bring\nHer, whom he waking euermore did weene,\nTo be the chastest flowre, that ay did spring\nOn earthly braunch, the daughter of a king,\nNow a loose Leman to vile seruice bound:\nAnd eke the Graces seemed all to sing,\nHymen i\u00f4 Hymen, dauncing all around,\nWhilst freshest Flora her with Yuie girlond crownd.\n\nIn this great passion of vnwonted lust,\nOr wonted feare of doing ought amis,\nHe started vp, as seeming to mistrust,\nSome secret ill, or hidden foe of his:\nLo there before his face his Lady is,\nVnder blake stole hyding her bayted hooke,\nAnd as halfe blushing offred him to kis,\nWith gentle blandishment and louely looke,\nMost like that virgin true, which for her knight him took.\n\nAll cleane dismayd to see so vncouth sight,\nAnd halfe enraged at her shamelesse guise,\nHe thought haue slaine her in his fierce despight:\nBut hasty heat tempring with sufferance wise,\nHe stayde his hand, and gan himselfe aduise\nTo proue his sense, and tempt her faigned truth.\n\nWringing her hands in wemens pitteous wise,\nTho can she weepe, to stirre vp gentle ruth,\nBoth for her noble bloud, and for her tender youth.\n\nAnd said, Ah Sir, my liege Lord and my loue,\nShall I accuse the hidden cruell fate,\nAnd mightie causes wrought in heauen aboue,\nOr the blind God, that doth me thus amate,\nFor hoped loue to winne me certaine hate?\n\nYet thus perforce he bids me do, or die.\n\nDie is my dew: yet rew my wretched state\nYou, whom my hard auenging destinie\nHath made iudge of my life or death indifferently.\n\nYour owne deare sake forst me at first to leaue\nMy Fathers kingdome,--There she stopt with teares;\nHer swollen hart her speach seemd to bereaue,\nAnd then againe begun, My weaker yeares\nCaptiu'd to fortune and frayle worldly feares,\nFly to your faith for succour and sure ayde:\nLet me not dye in languor and long teares.\n\nWhy Dame (quoth he) what hath ye thus dismayd?\n\nWhat frayes ye, that were wont to comfort me affrayd?\n\nLoue of your selfe, she said, and deare constraint\nLets me not sleepe, but wast the wearie night\nIn secret anguish and vnpittied plaint,\nWhiles you in carelesse sleepe are drowned quight.\n\nHer doubtfull words made that redoubted knight\nSuspect her truth: yet since no' vntruth he knew,\nHer fawning loue with foule disdainefull spight\nHe would not shend, but said, Deare dame I rew,\nThat for my sake vnknowne such griefe vnto you grew.\n\nAssure your selfe, it fell not all to ground;\nFor all so deare as life is to my hart,\nI deeme your loue, and hold me to you bound;\nNe let vaine feares procure your needlesse smart,\nWhere cause is none, but to your rest depart.\n\nNot all content, yet seemd she to appease\nHer mournefull plaintes, beguiled of her art,\nAnd fed with words, that could not chuse but please,\nSo slyding softly forth, she turnd as to her ease.\n\nLong after lay he musing at her mood,\nMuch grieu'd to thinke that gentle Dame so light,\nFor whose defence he was to shed his blood.\n\nAt last dull wearinesse of former fight\nHauing yrockt a sleepe his irkesome spright,\nThat troublous dreame gan freshly tosse his braine,\nWith bowres, and beds, and Ladies deare delight:\nBut when he saw his labour all was vaine,\nWith that misformed spright he backe returnd againe.\n\nForm:\nababbcbcc\nProem.\n\nBooks I-III were published in 1590, with an eloquent\ndedication to the Queen and an explanatory \"Letter of the\nAuthors\" addressed to Sir Walter Ralegh.\n\nIn the edition of\n1596, Books IV-VI were added, and in 1609 the \"Cantos\nof Mutabilitie.\n\n\" The text here printed is based on the 1596\nedition, the last edition in Spenser's lifetime.\n\nIn the \"Letter\"\nof 1590, Spenser describes the purpose and plan of his\npoem.\n\nIt is, he says, \"a continued Allegory, or darke conceit,\"\n\"the generall end\" of which \"is to fashion a gentleman or\nnoble person in vertuous and gentle discipline.\n\n\" Following\nwhat he, like his contemporaries, believed to be the didactic\npurpose of \"the antique Poets historicall,\" Homer and Virgil,\nand the example of the Italian writers of romantic epic,\nAriosto and Tasso, he sets out to portray in his hero Arthur\n\"the image of a brave knight, perfected in the twelve private\nmorall vertues, as Aristotle hath devised,\" in twelve books,\nin each of which another knight is to exhibit a particular\nvirtue, while in Prince Arthur, appearing in all, is ''sette\nforth magnificence .\n\n\nthe perfection of all the rest.\n\n\" Prince\nArthur's quest starts from his \"dream or vision of the Faery\nQueen,\" who represents \"glory in my generall intention,\" but\nin particular \"the excellent and glorious person of our soveraine\nthe Queene.\n\n\" According to \"the methode of a Poet historicall,\"\nSpenser \"thrusteth into the middest\" of his story, proposing in\nthe twelfth book to relate how the several adventures were entered\nupon at the twelve-day feast of Gloriana in her city of Cleopolis.\n\nThe six completed books, their virtues and \"patrones,\" are: 1:\nHoliness (the Red-crosse knight)\\; II: Temperance (Sir Guyon)\\;\nIII: Chastity (Britomart, \"a Lady knight'')\\; IV: Friendship\n(Cambell and Triamond)\\; V: Justice (Sir Artegall)\\; VI: Courtesy (Sir Calidore).\n\nOn the first day of the feast, ''a tall clownishe younge man\"\nhaving desired the achievement of that day's adventure, soon\nentered \"a faire Ladye in mourning weedes, riding on a white\nAsse, with a dwarfe behind her leading a warlike steed, that\nbore the Armes of a knight.\n\n\nShee complayned that her father\nand mother an ancient King and Queene, had bene by an huge\ndragon many years shut up in a brasen Castle.\n\n\" The young man\nearnestly desired that adventure, and the Lady told him \"that\nunlesse that armour which she brought would serve him (that\nis the armour of a Christian man specified by Saint Paul, Ephesians\n6) that he could not succeed in that enterprise.\n\n\" Then, \"eftsoones\ntaking on him knighthood,\" he went forth with her, \"where\nbeginneth the first booke.\n\nThe first four lines

is told.\n\nThe Gardins of Adonis fraught\nWith pleasures manifold.\n\nVVell may I weene, faire Ladies, all this while\nYe wonder, how this noble Damozell\nSo great perfections did in her compile,\nSith that in saluage forests she did dwell,\nSo farre from court and royall Citadell,\nThe great schoolmistresse of all curtesy:\nSeemeth that such wild woods should far expell\nAll ciuill vsage and gentility,\nAnd gentle sprite deforme with rude rusticity.\n\nBut to this faire Belphoebe in her berth\nThe heauens so fauourable were and free,\nLooking with myld aspect vpon the earth,\nIn th'Horoscope of her natiuitee,\nThat all the gifts of grace and chastitee\nOn her they poured forth of plenteous horne;\nIoue laught on Venus from his soueraigne see,\nAnd Phoebus with faire beames did her adorne,\nAnd all the Graces rockt her cradle being borne.\n\nHer berth was of the wombe of Morning dew,\nAnd her conception of the ioyous Prime,\nAnd all her whole creation did her shew\nPure and vnspotted from all loathly crime,\nThat is ingenerate in fleshly slime.\n\nSo was this virgin borne, so was she bred,\nSo was she trayned vp from time to time,\nIn all chast vertue, and true bounti-hed\nTill to her dew perfection she was ripened.\n\nHer mother was the faire Chrysogonee,\nThe daughter of Amphisa, who by race\nA Faerie was, yborne of high degree,\nShe bore Belphoebe, she bore in like cace\nFaire Amoretta in the second place:\nThese two were twinnes, & twixt them two did share\nThe heritage of all celestiall grace.\n\nThat all the rest it seem'd they robbed bare\nOf bountie, and of beautie, and all vertues rare.\n\nIt were a goodly storie, to declare,\nBy what straunge accident faire Chrysogone\nConceiu'd these infants, and how them she bare,\nIn this wild forrest wandring all alone,\nAfter she had nine moneths fulfild and gone:\nFor not as other wemens commune brood,\nThey were enwombed in the sacred throne\nOf her chaste bodie, nor with commune food,\nAs other wemens babes, they sucked vitall blood.\n\nBut wondrously they were begot, and bred\nThrough influence of th'heauens fruitfull ray,\nAs it in antique bookes is mentioned.\n\nIt was vpon a Sommers shynie day,\nWhen Titan faire his beames did display,\nIn a fresh fountaine, farre from all mens vew,\nShe bath'd her brest, the boyling heat t'allay;\nShe bath'd with roses red, and violets blew,\nAnd all the sweetest flowres, that in the forrest grew.\n\nTill faint through irkesome wearinesse, adowne\nVpon the grassie ground her selfe she layd\nTo sleepe, the whiles a gentle slombring swowne\nVpon her fell all naked bare displayd;\nThe sunne-beames bright vpon her body playd,\nBeing through former bathing mollifide,\nAnd pierst into her wombe, where they embayd\nWith so sweet sence and secret power vnspide,\nThat in her pregnant flesh they shortly fructifide.\n\nMiraculous may seeme to him, that reades\nSo straunge ensample of conception;\nBut reason teacheth that the fruitfull seades\nOf all things liuing, through impression\nOf the sunbeames in moyst complexion,\nDoe life conceiue and quickned are by kynd:\nSo after Nilus invndation,\nInfinite shapes of creatures men do fynd,\nInformed in the mud, on which the Sunne hath shynd.\n\nGreat father he of generation\nIs rightly cald, th'author of life and light;\nAnd his faire sister for creation\nMinistreth matter fit, which tempred right\nWith heate and humour, breedes the liuing wight.\n\nSo sprong these twinnes in wombe of Chrysogone,\nYet wist she nought thereof, but sore affright,\nWondred to see her belly so vpblone,\nWhich still increast, till she her terme had full outgone.\n\nWhereof conceiuing shame and foule disgrace,\nAlbe her guiltlesse conscience her cleard,\nShe fled into the wildernesse a space,\nTill that vnweeldy burden she had reard,\nAnd shund dishonor, which as death she feard:\nWhere wearie of long trauell, downe to rest\nHer selfe she set, and comfortably cheard;\nThere a sad cloud of sleepe her ouerkest,\nAnd seized euery sense with sorrow sore opprest.\n\nIt fortuned, faire Venus hauing lost\nHer little sonne, the winged god of loue,\nWho for some light displeasure, which him crost,\nWas from her fled, as flit as ayerie Doue,\nAnd left her blisfull bowre of ioy aboue,\n(So from her often he had fled away,\nWhen she for ought him sharpely did reproue,\nAnd wandred in the world in strange aray,\nDisguiz'd in thousand shapes, that none might him bewray.\n\nHim for to seeke, she left her heauenly hous,\nThe house of goodly formes and faire aspects,\nWhence all the world deriues the glorious\nFeatures of beautie, and all shapes select,\nWith which high God his workmanship hath deckt;\nAnd searched euery way, through which his wings\nHad borne him, or his tract she mote detect:\nShe promist kisses sweet, and sweeter things\nVnto the man, that of him tydings to her brings.\n\nFirst she him sought in Court, where most he vsed\nWhylome to haunt, but there she found him not;\nBut many there she found, which sore accused\nHis falsehood, and with foule infamous blot\nHis cruell deedes and wicked wyles did spot:\nLadies and Lords she euery where mote heare\nComplayning, how with his empoysned shot\nTheir wofull harts he wounded had whyleare,\nAnd so had left them languishing twixt hope and feare.\n\nShe then the Citties sought from gate to gate,\nAnd euery one did aske, did he him see;\nAnd euery one her answerd, that too late\nHe had him seene, and felt the crueltie\nOf his sharpe darts and whot artillerie;\nAnd euery one threw forth reproches rife\nOf his mischieuous deedes, and said, that hee\nWas the disturber of all ciuill life,\nThe enimy of peace, and author of all strife.\n\nThen in the countrey she abroad him sought,\nAnd in the rurall cottages inquired,\nWhere also many plaints to her were brought,\nHow he their heedlesse harts with loue had fyred,\nAnd his false venim through their veines inspyred;\nAnd eke the gentle shepheard swaynes, which sat\nKeeping their fleecie flockes, as they were hyred,\nShe sweetly heard complaine, both how and what\nHer sonne had to them doen; yet she did smile thereat.\n\nBut when in none of all these she him got,\nShe gan auize, where else he mote him hyde:\nAt last she her bethought, that she had not\nYet sought the saluage woods and forrests wyde,\nIn which full many louely Nymphes abyde,\nMongst whom might be, that he did closely lye,\nOr that the loue of some of them him tyde:\nFor thy, she thither cast her course t'apply,\nTo search the secret haunts of Dianes company.\n\nShortly vnto the wastefull woods she came,\nWhereas she found the Goddesse with her crew,\nAfter late chace of their embrewed game,\nSitting beside a fountaine in a rew,\nSome of them washing with the liquid dew\nFrom off their dainty limbes the dustie sweat,\nAnd soyle which did deforme their liuely hew;\nOthers lay shaded from the scorching heat;\nThe rest vpon her person gaue attendance great.\n\nShe hauing hong vpon a bough on high\nHer bow and painted quiuer, had vnlaste\nHer siluer buskins from her nimble thigh,\nAnd her lancke loynes vngirt, and brests vnbraste,\nAfter her heat the breathing cold to taste;\nHer golden lockes, that late in tresses bright\nEmbreaded were for hindring of her haste,\nNow loose about her shoulders hong vndight,\nAnd were with sweet Ambrosia all besprinckled light.\n\nSoone as she Venus saw behind her backe,\nShe was asham'd to be so loose surprized,\nAnd woxe halfe wroth against her damzels slacke,\nThat had not her thereof before auized,\nBut suffred her so carelesly disguized\nBe ouertaken.\n\nSoone her garments loose\nVpgath'ring, in her bosome she comprized,\nWell as she might, and to the Goddesse rose,\nWhiles all her Nymphes did like a girlond her enclose.\n\nGoodly she gan faire Cytherea greet,\nAnd shortly asked her, what cause her brought\nInto that wildernesse for her vnmeet,\nFrom her sweet bowres, and beds with pleasures fraught:\nThat suddein change she strange aduenture thought.\n\nTo whom halfe weeping, she thus answered,\nThat she her dearest sonne Cupido sought,\nWho in his frowardnesse from her was fled;\nThat she repented sore, to haue him angered.\n\nThereat Diana gan to smile, in scorne\nOf her vaine plaint, and to her scoffing sayd;\nGreat pittie sure, that ye be so forlorne\nOf your gay sonne, that giues ye so good ayd\nTo your disports: ill mote ye bene apayd.\n\nBut she was more engrieued, and replide;\nFaire sister, ill beseemes it to vpbrayd\nA dolefull heart with so disdainfull pride;\nThe like that mine, may be your paine another tide.\n\nAs you in woods and wanton wildernesse\nYour glory set, to chace the saluage beasts,\nSo my delight is all in ioyfulnesse,\nIn beds, in bowres, in banckets, and in feasts:\nAnd ill becomes you with your loftie creasts,\nTo scorne the ioy, that Ioue is glad to seeke;\nWe both are bound to follow heauens beheasts,\nAnd tend our charges with obeisance meeke:\nSpare, gentle sister, with reproch my paine to eeke.\n\nAnd tell me, if that ye my sonne haue heard,\nTo lurke emongst your Nymphes in secret wize;\nOr keepe their cabins: much I am affeard,\nLeast he like one of them him selfe disguize,\nAnd turne his arrowes to their exercize:\nSo may he long himselfe full easie hide:\nFor he is faire and fresh in face and guize,\nAs any Nymph (let not it be enuyde,)\nSo saying euery Nymph full narrowly she eyde.\n\nBut Phoebe therewith sore was angered,\nAnd sharply said; Goe Dame, goe seeke your boy,\nWhere you him lately left, in Mars his bed;\nHe comes not here, we scorne his foolish ioy,\nNe lend we leisure to his idle toy:\nBut if I catch him in this company,\nBy Stygian lake I vow, whose sad annoy\nThe Gods doe dread, he dearely shall abye:\nIle clip his wanton wings, that he no more shall fly.\n\nWhom when as Venus saw so sore displeased,\nShe inly sory was, and gan relent,\nWhat she had said: so her she soone appeased,\nWith sugred words and gentle blandishment,\nWhich as a fountaine from her sweet lips went,\nAnd welled goodly forth, that in short space\nShe was well pleasd, and forth her damzels sent,\nThrough all the woods, to search from place to place,\nIf any tract of him or tydings they mote trace.\n\nTo search the God of loue, her Nymphes she sent\nThroughout the wandring forrest euery where:\nAnd after them her selfe eke with her went\nTo seeke the fugitiue, both farre and nere,\nSo long they sought, till they arriued were\nIn that same shadie couert, whereas lay\nFaire Crysogone in slombry traunce whilere:\nWho in her sleepe (a wondrous thing to say)\nVnwares had borne two babes, as faire as springing day.\n\nVnwares she them conceiu'd, vnwares she bore:\nShe bore withouten paine, that she conceiued\nWithouten pleasure: ne her need implore\nLucinaes aide: which when they both perceiued,\nThey were through wonder nigh of sense bereaued,\nAnd gazing each on other, nought bespake:\nAt last they both agreed, her seeming grieued\nOut of her heauy swowne not to awake,\nBut from her louing side the tender babes to take.\n\nVp they them tooke, each one a babe vptooke,\nAnd with them carried, to be fostered;\nDame Phoebe to a Nymph her babe betooke,\nTo be vpbrought in perfect Maydenhed,\nAnd of her selfe her name Belphoebe red:\nBut Venus hers thence farre away conuayd,\nTo be vpbrought in goodly womanhed,\nAnd in her litle loues stead, which was strayd,\nHer Amoretta cald, to comfort her dismayd.\n\nShe brought her to her ioyous Paradize,\nWhere most she wonnes, when she on earth does dwel.\n\nSo faire a place, as Nature can deuize:\nWhether in Paphos, or Cytheron hill,\nOr it in Gnidus be, I wote not well;\nBut well I wote by tryall, that this same\nAll other pleasant places doth excell,\nAnd called is by her lost louers name,\nThe Gardin of Adonis, farre renowmd by fame.\n\nIn that same Gardin all the goodly flowres,\nWherewith dame Nature doth her beautifie,\nAnd decks the girlonds of her paramoures,\nAre fetcht: there is the first seminarie\nOf all things, that are borne to liue and die,\nAccording to their kindes.\n\nLong worke it were,\nHere to account the endlesse progenie\nOf all the weedes, that bud and blossome there;\nBut so much as doth need, must needs be counted here.\n\nIt sited was in fruitfull soyle of old,\nAnd girt in with two walles on either side;\nThe one of yron, the other of bright gold,\nThat none might thorough breake, nor ouer-stride:\nAnd double gates it had, which opened wide,\nBy which both in and out men moten pas;\nTh'one faire and fresh, the other old and dride:\nOld Genius the porter of them was,\nOld Genius, the which a double nature has.\n\nHe letteth in, he letteth out to wend,\nAll that to come into the world desire;\nA thousand thousand naked babes attend\nAbout him day and night, which doe require,\nThat he with fleshly weedes would them attire:\nSuch as him list, such as eternall fate\nOrdained hath, he clothes with sinfull mire,\nAnd sendeth forth to liue in mortall state,\nTill they againe returne backe by the hinder gate.\n\nAfter that they againe returned beene,\nThey in that Gardin planted be againe;\nAnd grow afresh, as they had neuer seene\nFleshly corruption, nor mortall paine.\n\nSome thousand yeares so doen they there remaine;\nAnd then of him are clad with other hew,\nOr sent into the chaungefull world againe,\nTill thither they returne, where first they grew:\nSo like a wheele around they runne from old to new.\n\nNe needs there Gardiner to set, or sow,\nTo plant or prune: for of their owne accord\nAll things, as they created were, doe grow,\nAnd yet remember well the mightie word,\nWhich first was spoken by th'Almightie lord,\nThat bad them to increase and multiply:\nNe doe they need with water of the ford,\nOr of the clouds to moysten their roots dry;\nFor in themselues eternall moisture they imply.\n\nInfinite shapes of creatures there are bred,\nAnd vncouth formes, which none yet euer knew,\nAnd euery sort is in a sundry bed\nSet by it selfe, and ranckt in comely rew:\nSome fit for reasonable soules t'indew,\nSome made for beasts, some made for birds to weare,\nAnd all the fruitfull spawne of fishes hew\nIn endlesse rancks along enraunged were,\nThat seem'd the Ocean could not containe them there.\n\nDaily they grow, and daily forth are sent\nInto the world, it to replenish more;\nYet is the stocke not lessened, nor spent,\nBut still remaines in euerlasting store,\nAs it at first created was of yore.\n\nFor in the wide wombe of the world there lyes,\nIn hatefull darkenesse and in deepe horrore,\nAn huge eternall Chaos, which supplyes\nThe substances of natures fruitfull progenyes.\n\nAll things from thence doe their first being fetch,\nAnd borrow matter, whereof they are made,\nWhich when as forme and feature it does ketch,\nBecomes a bodie, and doth then inuade\nThe state of life, out of the griesly shade.\n\nThat substance is eterne, and bideth so,\nNe when the life decayes, and forme does fade,\nDoth it consume, and into nothing go,\nBut chaunged is, and often altred to and fro.\n\nThe substance is not chaunged, nor altered,\nBut th'only forme and outward fashion;\nFor euery substance is conditioned\nTo change her hew, and sundry formes to don,\nMeet for her temper and complexion:\nFor formes are variable and decay,\nBy course of kind, and by occasion;\nAnd that faire flowre of beautie fades away,\nAs doth the lilly fresh before the sunny ray.\n\nGreat enimy to it, and to all the rest,\nThat in the Gardin of Adonis springs,\nIs wicked Time, who with his scyth addrest,\nDoes mow the flowring herbes and goodly things,\nAnd all their glory to the ground downe flings,\nWhere they doe wither, and are fowly mard:\nHe flyes about, and with his flaggy wings\nBeates downe both leaues and buds without regard,\nNe euer pittie may relent his malice hard.\n\nYet pittie often did the gods relent,\nTo see so faire things mard, and spoyled quight:\nAnd their great mother Venus did lament\nThe losse of her deare brood, her deare delight:\nHer hart was pierst with pittie at the sight,\nWhen walking through the Gardin, them she spyde,\nYet no'te she find redresse for such despight.\n\nFor all that liues, is subiect to that law:\nAll things decay in time, and to their end do draw.\n\nBut were it not, that Time their troubler is,\nAll that in this delightfull Gardin growes,\nShould happie be, and haue immortall blis:\nFor here all plentie, and all pleasure flowes,\nAnd sweet loue gentle fits emongst them throwes,\nWithout fell rancor, or fond gealosie;\nFranckly each paramour his leman knowes,\nEach bird his mate, ne any does enuie\nTheir goodly meriment, and gay felicitie.\n\nThere is continuall spring, and haruest there\nContinuall, both meeting at one time:\nFor both the boughes doe laughing blossomes beare,\nAnd with fresh colours decke the wanton Prime,\nAnd eke attonce the heauy trees they clime,\nWhich seeme to labour vnder their fruits lode:\nThe whiles the ioyous birdes make their pastime\nEmongst the shadie leaues, their sweet abode,\nAnd their true loues without suspition tell abrode.\n\nRight in the middest of that Paradise,\nThere stood a stately Mount, on whose round top\nA gloomy groue of mirtle trees did rise,\nWhose shadie boughes sharpe steele did neuer lop,\nNor wicked beasts their tender buds did crop,\nBut like a girlond compassed the hight,\nAnd from their fruitfull sides sweet gum did drop,\nThat all the ground with precious deaw bedight,\nThrew forth most dainty odours, & most sweet delight.\n\nAnd in the thickest couert of that shade,\nThere was a pleasant arbour, not by art,\nBut of the trees owne inclination made,\nWhich knitting their rancke braunches part to part,\nWith wanton yuie twyne entrayld athwart,\nAnd Eglantine, and Caprifole emong,\nFashiond aboue within their inmost part,\nThat nether Phoebus beams could through the\nm\nthrong,\nNor Aeolus sharp blast could worke them any wrong.\n\nAnd all about grew euery sort of flowre,\nTo which sad louers were transformd of yore;\nFresh Hyacinthus, Phoebus paramoure,\nAnd dearest loue:\nFoolish Narcisse, that likes the watry shore,\nSad Amaranthus, made a flowre but late,\nSad Amaranthus, in whose purple gore\nMe seemes I see Amintas wretched fate,\nTo whom sweet Poets verse hath giuen endlesse date.\n\nThere wont faire Venus often to enioy\nHer deare Adonis ioyous company,\nAnd reape sweet pleasure of the wanton boy;\nThere yet, some say, in secret he does ly,\nLapped in flowres and pretious spycery,\nBy her hid from the world, and from the skill\nOf Stygian Gods, which doe her loue enuy;\nBut she her selfe, when euer that she will,\nPossesseth him, and of his sweetnesse takes her fill.\n\nAnd sooth it seemes they say: for he may not\nFor euer die, and euer buried bee\nIn balefull night, where all things are forgot;\nAll be he subiect to mortalitie,\nYet is eterne in mutabilitie,\nAnd by succession made perpetuall,\nTransformed oft, and chaunged diuerslie:\nFor him the Father of all formes they call;\nTherefore needs mote he liue, that liuing giues to all.\n\nThere now he liueth in eternall blis,\nIoying his goddesse, and of her enioyd:\nNe feareth he henceforth that foe of his,\nWhich with his cruell tuske him deadly cloyd:\nFor that wilde Bore, the which him once annoyd,\nShe firmely hath emprisoned for ay,\nThat her sweet loue his malice mote auoyd,\nIn a strong rocky Caue, which is they say,\nHewen vnderneath that Mount, that none him losen may.\n\nThere now he liues in euerlasting ioy,\nWith many of the Gods in company,\nWhich thither haunt, and with the winged boy\nSporting himselfe in safe felicity:\nWho when he hath with spoiles and cruelty\nRansackt the world, and in the wofull harts\nOf many wretches set his triumphes hye,\nThither resorts, and laying his sad darts\nAside, with faire Adonis playes his wanton parts.\n\nAnd his true loue faire Psyche with him playes,\nFaire Psyche to him lately reconcyld,\nAfter long troubles and vnmeet vpbrayes,\nWith which his mother Venus her reuyld,\nAnd eke himselfe her cruelly exyld:\nBut now in stedfast loue and happy state\nShe with him liues, and hath him borne a chyld,\nPleasure, that doth both gods and men aggrate,\nPleasure, the daughter of Cupid and Psyche late.\n\nHither great Venus brought this infant faire,\nThe younger daughter of Chrysogonee,\nAnd vnto Psyche with great trust and care\nCommitted her, yfostered to bee,\nAnd trained vp in true feminitee:\nWho no lesse carefully her tendered,\nThen her owne daughter Pleasure, to whom shee\nMade her companion, and her lessoned\nIn all the lore of loue, and goodly womanhead.\n\nIn which when she to perfect ripenesse grew,\nOf grace and beautie noble Paragone,\nShe brought her forth into the worldes vew,\nTo be th'ensample of true loue alone,\nAnd Lodestarre of all chaste affectione,\nTo all faire Ladies, that doe liue on ground.\n\nTo Faery court she came, where many one\nAdmyrd her goodly haueour, and found\nHis feeble hart wide launched with loues cruell wound.\n\nBut she to none of them her loue did cast,\nSaue to the noble knight Sir Scudamore,\nTo whom her louing hart she linked fast\nIn faithfull loue, t'abide for euer more,\nAnd for his dearest sake endured sore,\nSore trouble of an hainous enimy;\nWho her would forced haue to haue forlore\nHer former loue, and stedfast loialty,\nAs ye may elsewhere read that ruefull history.\n\nBut well I weene, ye first desire to learne,\nWhat end vnto that fearefull Damozell,\nWhich fled so fast from that same foster stearne,\nWhom with his brethren Timias slew, befell:\nThat was to weet, the goodly Florimell;\nWho wandring for to seeke her louer deare,\nHer louer deare, her dearest Marinell,\nInto misfortune fell, as ye did heare,\nAnd from Prince Arthur fled with wings of idle feare.\n", "period": "Elizabethan", "literary_movement": "Renaissance", "register": "Formal", "rhetorical_genre":

Hero the fair,\nWhom young Apollo courted for her hair,\nAnd offer'd as a dower his burning throne,\nWhere she could sit for men to gaze upon.\n\nThe outside of her garments were of lawn,\nThe lining purple silk, with gilt stars drawn;\nHer wide sleeves green, and border'd with a grove,\nWhere Venus in her naked glory strove\nTo please the careless and disdainful eyes\nOf proud Adonis, that before her lies;\nHer kirtle blue, whereon was many a stain,\nMade with the blood of wretched lovers slain.\n\nUpon her head she ware a myrtle wreath,\nFrom whence her veil reach'd to the ground beneath;\nHer veil was artificial flowers and leaves,\nWhose workmanship both man and beast deceives;\nMany would praise the sweet smell as she past,\nWhen 'twas the odour which her breath forth cast;\nAnd there for honey bees have sought in vain,\nAnd beat from thence, have lighted there again.\n\nAbout her neck hung chains of pebble-stone,\nWhich lighten'd by her neck, like diamonds shone.\n\nShe ware no gloves; for neither sun nor wind\nWould burn or parch her hands, but, to her mind,\nOr warm or cool them, for they took delight\nTo play upon those hands, they were so white.\n\nBuskins of shells, all silver'd, used she,\nAnd branch'd with blushing coral to the knee;\nWhere sparrows perch'd, of hollow pearl and gold,\nSuch as the world would wonder to behold:\nThose with sweet water oft her handmaid fills,\nWhich as she went, would chirrup through the bills.\n\nSome say, for her the fairest Cupid pin'd,\nAnd looking in her face, was strooken blind.\n\nBut this is true; so like was one the other,\nAs he imagin'd Hero was his mother;\nAnd oftentimes into her bosom flew,\nAbout her naked neck his bare arms threw,\nAnd laid his childish head upon her breast,\nAnd with still panting rock'd there took his rest.\n\nSo lovely-fair was Hero, Venus' nun,\nAs Nature wept, thinking she was undone,\nBecause she took more from her than she left,\nAnd of such wondrous beauty her bereft:\nTherefore, in sign her treasure suffer'd wrack,\nSince Hero's time hath half the world been black.\n\nAmorous Leander, beautiful and young\n(Whose tragedy divine Mus\u00e6us sung),\nDwelt at Abydos; since him dwelt there none\nFor whom succeeding times make greater moan.\n\nHis dangling tresses, that were never shorn,\nHad they been cut, and unto Colchos borne,\nWould have allur'd the vent'rous youth of Greece\nTo hazard more than for the golden fleece.\n\nFair Cynthia wish'd his arms might be her sphere;\nGrief makes her pale, because she moves not there.\n\nHis body was as straight as Circe's wand;\nJove might have sipt out nectar from his hand.\n\nEven as delicious meat is to the taste,\nSo was his neck in touching, and surpast\nThe white of Pelops' shoulder: I could tell ye,\nHow smooth his breast was, and how white his belly;\nAnd whose immortal fingers did imprint\nThat heavenly path with many a curious dint\nThat runs along his back; but my rude pen\nCan hardly blazon forth the loves of men,\nMuch less of powerful gods: let it suffice\nThat my slack Muse sings of Leander's eyes;\nThose orient cheeks and lips, exceeding his\nThat leapt into the water for a kiss\nOf his own shadow, and, despising many,\nDied ere he could enjoy the love of any.\n\nHad wild Hippolytus Leander seen,\nEnamour'd of his beauty had he been.\n\nHis presence made the rudest peasant melt,\nThat in the vast uplandish country dwelt;\nThe barbarous Thracian soldier, mov'd with nought,\nWas mov'd with him, and for his favour sought.\n\nSome swore he was a maid in man's attire,\nFor in his looks were all that men desire,\u2014\nA pleasant smiling cheek, a speaking eye,\nA brow for love to banquet royally;\nAnd such as knew he was a man, would say,\n\"Leander, thou art made for amorous play;\nWhy art thou not in love, and lov'd of all?\n\nThough thou be fair, yet be not thine own thrall.\n\n\nThe men of wealthy Sestos every year,\nFor his sake whom their goddess held so dear,\nRose-cheek'd Adonis, kept a solemn feast.\n\nThither resorted many a wandering guest\nTo meet their loves; such as had none at all\nCame lovers home from this great festival;\nFor every street, like to a firmament,\nGlister'd with breathing stars, who, where they went,\nFrighted the melancholy earth, which deem'd\nEternal heaven to burn, for so it seem'd\nAs if another Pha{\"e}ton had got\nThe guidance of the sun's rich chariot.\n\nBut far above the loveliest, Hero shin'd,\nAnd stole away th' enchanted gazer's mind;\nFor like sea-nymphs' inveigling harmony,\nSo was her beauty to the standers-by;\nNor that night-wandering, pale, and watery star\n(When yawning dragons draw her thirling car\nFrom Latmus' mount up to the gloomy sky,\nWhere, crown'd with blazing light and majesty,\nShe proudly sits) more over-rules the flood\nThan she the hearts of those that near her stood.\n\nEven as when gaudy nymphs pursue the chase,\nWretched Ixion's shaggy-footed race,\nIncens'd with savage heat, gallop amain\nFrom steep pine-bearing mountains to the plain,\nSo ran the people forth to gaze upon her,\nAnd all that view'd her were enamour'd on her.\n\nAnd as in fury of a dreadful fight,\nTheir fellows being slain or put to flight,\nPoor soldiers stand with fear of death dead-strooken,\nSo at her presence all surpris'd and tooken,\nAwait the sentence of her scornful eyes;\nHe whom she favours lives; the other dies.\n\nThere might you see one sigh, another rage,\nAnd some, their violent passions to assuage,\nCompile sharp satires; but, alas, too late,\nFor faithful love will never turn to hate.\n\nAnd many, seeing great princes were denied,\nPin'd as they went, and thinking on her, died.\n\nOn this feast-day\u2014O cursed day and hour!\u2014\nWent Hero thorough Sestos, from her tower\nTo Venus' temple, where unhappily,\nAs after chanc'd, they did each other spy.\n\nSo fair a church as this had Venus none:\nThe walls were of discolour'd jasper-stone,\nWherein was Proteus carved; and over-head\nA lively vine of green sea-agate spread,\nWhere by one hand light-headed Bacchus hung,\nAnd with the other wine from grapes out-wrung.\n\nOf crystal shining fair the pavement was;\nThe town of Sestos call'd it Venus' glass:\nThere might you see the gods in sundry shapes,\nCommitting heady riots, incest, rapes:\nFor know, that underneath this radiant flower\nWas Danae's statue in a brazen tower,\nJove slyly stealing from his sister's bed,\nTo dally with Idalian Ganimed,\nAnd for his love Europa bellowing loud,\nAnd tumbling with the rainbow in a cloud;\nBlood-quaffing Mars heaving the iron net,\nWhich limping Vulcan and his Cyclops set;\nLove kindling fire, to burn such towns as Troy,\nSylvanus weeping for the lovely boy\nThat now is turn'd into a cypress tree,\nUnder whose shade the wood-gods love to be.\n\nAnd in the midst a silver altar stood:\nThere Hero, sacrificing turtles' blood,\nVail'd to the ground, veiling her eyelids close;\nAnd modestly they opened as she rose.\n\nThence flew Love's arrow with the golden head;\nAnd thus Leander was enamoured.\n\nStone-still he stood, and evermore he gazed,\nTill with the fire that from his count'nance blazed\nRelenting Hero's gentle heart was strook:\nSuch force and virtue hath an amorous look.\n\nIt lies not in our power to love or hate,\nFor will in us is over-rul'd by fate.\n\nWhen two are stript, long ere the course begin,\nWe wish that one should lose, the other win;\nAnd one especially do we affect\nOf two gold ingots, like in each respect:\nThe reason no man knows, let it suffice,\nWhat we behold is censur'd by our eyes.\n\nWhere both deliberate, the love is slight:\nWho ever lov'd, that lov'd not at first sight?\n", "period": "Elizabethan", "literary_movement": "Elizabethan Drama", "register": "Elevated", "rhetorical_genre": "Epideictic", "discursive_structure": "Monologue", "discourse_type": "Narrative", "narrative_level": "Third person", "diegetic_mimetic": "Mimetic", "focalization": "External", "person": "Third person omniscient", "deictic_orientation": "Extradiegetic", "addressee_type": "General", "deictic_object": NaN, "temporal_orientation": "Past", "temporal_structure": "Linear", "tradition": "Classical", "mode": "Narrative", "genre": "Epic Poem", "stanza_structure": "Quatrains", "meter": "Iambic pentameter", "rhyme": "AABBCC"}

It labour'd to frustrate\nEven God's purpose; and made woman, sent\nFor man's relief, cause of his languishment.\n\nThey were to good ends, and they are so still,\nBut accessory, and principal in ill,\nFor that first marriage was our funeral;\nOne woman at one blow, then kill'd us all,\nAnd singly, one by one, they kill us now.\n\nWe do delightfully our selves allow\nTo that consumption; and profusely blind,\nWe kill our selves to propagate our kind.\n\nAnd yet we do not that; we are not men;\nThere is not now that mankind, which was then,\nWhen as the sun and man did seem to strive,\n(Joint tenants of the world) who should survive;\nWhen stag, and raven, and the long-liv'd tree,\nCompar'd with man, died in minority;\nWhen, if a slow-pac'd star had stol'n away\nFrom the observer's marking, he might stay\nTwo or three hundred years to see't again,\nAnd then make up his observation plain;\nWhen, as the age was long, the size was great\n(Man's growth confess'd, and recompens'd the meat),\nSo spacious and large, that every soul\nDid a fair kingdom, and large realm control;\nAnd when the very stature, thus erect,\nDid that soul a good way towards heaven direct.\n\nWhere is this mankind now?\n\nWho lives to age,\nFit to be made Methusalem his page?\n\nAlas, we scarce live long enough to try\nWhether a true-made clock run right, or lie.\n\nOld grandsires talk of yesterday with sorrow,\nAnd for our children we reserve tomorrow.\n\nSo short is life, that every peasant strives,\nIn a torn house, or field, to have three lives.\n\nAnd as in lasting, so in length is man\nContracted to an inch, who was a span;\nFor had a man at first in forests stray'd,\nOr shipwrack'd in the sea, one would have laid\nA wager, that an elephant, or whale,\nThat met him, would not hastily assail\nA thing so equall to him; now alas,\nThe fairies, and the pigmies well may pass\nAs credible; mankind decays so soon,\nWe'are scarce our fathers' shadows cast at noon,\nOnly death adds t'our length: nor are we grown\nIn stature to be men, till we are none.\n\nBut this were light, did our less volume hold\nAll the old text; or had we chang'd to gold\nTheir silver; or dispos'd into less glass\nSpirits of virtue, which then scatter'd was.\n\nBut 'tis not so; w'are not retir'd, but damp'd;\nAnd as our bodies, so our minds are cramp'd;\n'Tis shrinking, not close weaving, that hath thus\nIn mind and body both bedwarfed us.\n\nWe seem ambitious, God's whole work t'undo;\nOf nothing he made us, and we strive too,\nTo bring our selves to nothing back; and we\nDo what we can, to do't so soon as he.\n\nWith new diseases on our selves we war,\nAnd with new physic, a worse engine far.\n\nThus man, this world's vice-emperor, in whom\nAll faculties, all graces are at home\n(And if in other creatures they appear,\nThey're but man's ministers and legates there\nTo work on their rebellions, and reduce\nThem to civility, and to man's use);\nThis man, whom God did woo, and loath t'attend\nTill man came up, did down to man descend,\nThis man, so great, that all that is, is his,\nO what a trifle, and poor thing he is!\nIf man were anything, he's nothing now;\nHelp, or at least some time to waste, allow\nT'his other wants, yet when he did depart\nWith her whom we lament, he lost his heart.\n\nShe, of whom th'ancients seem'd to prophesy,\nWhen they call'd virtues by the name ofshe;\nShe in whom virtue was so much refin'd,\nThat for alloy unto so pure a mind\nShe took the weaker sex; she that could drive\nThe poisonous tincture, and the stain of Eve,\nOut of her thoughts, and deeds, and purify\nAll, by a true religious alchemy,\nShe, she is dead; she's dead: when thou knowest this,\nThou knowest how poor a trifling thing man is,\nAnd learn'st thus much by our anatomy,\nThe heart being perish'd, no part can be free,\nAnd that except thou feed (not banquet) on\nThe supernatural food, religion,\nThy better growth grows withered, and scant;\nBe more than man, or thou'rt less than an ant.\n\nThen, as mankind, so is the world's whole frame\nQuite out of joint, almost created lame,\nFor, before God had made up all the rest,\nCorruption ent'red, and deprav'd the best;\nIt seiz'd the angels, and then first of all\nThe world did in her cradle take a fall,\nAnd turn'd her brains, and took a general maim,\nWronging each joint of th'universal frame.\n\nThe noblest part, man, felt it first; and then\nBoth beasts and plants, curs'd in the curse of man.\n\nSo did the world from the first hour decay,\nThat evening was beginning of the day,\nAnd now the springs and summers which we see,\nLike sons of women after fifty be.\n\nAnd new philosophy calls all in doubt,\nThe element of fire is quite put out,\nThe sun is lost, and th'earth, and no man's wit\nCan well direct him where to look for it.\n\nAnd freely men confess that this world's spent,\nWhen in the planets and the firmament\nThey seek so many new; they see that this\nIs crumbled out again to his atomies.\n\n'Tis all in pieces, all coherence gone,\nAll just supply, and all relation;\nPrince, subject, father, son, are things forgot,\nFor every man alone thinks he hath got\nTo be a phoenix, and that then can be\nNone of that kind, of which he is, but he.\n\nThis is the world's condition now, and now\nShe that should all parts to reunion bow,\nShe that had all magnetic force alone,\nTo draw, and fasten sund'red parts in one;\nShe whom wise nature had invented then\nWhen she observ'd that every sort of men\nDid in their voyage in this world's sea stray,\nAnd needed a new compass for their way;\nShe that was best and first original\nOf all fair copies, and the general\nSteward to fate;

and approach so one the t'other\nTill either grew a portion of the other;\nEach styled by his end,\nThe copy of his friend.\n\nYou liv'd to be the great surnames\nAnd titles by which all made claims\nUnto the virtue: nothing perfect done,\nBut as a Cary or a Morison.\n\nTHE STAND\nAnd such a force the fair example had,\nAs they that saw\nThe good and durst not practise it, were glad\nThat such a law\nWas left yet to mankind;\nWhere they might read and find\nFriendship, indeed, was written not in words:\nAnd with the heart, not pen,\nOf two so early men,\nWhose lines her rolls were, and records;\nWho, ere the first down bloomed on the chin,\nHad sow'd these fruits, and got the harvest in.\n\nTO THE IMMORTAL MEMORY AND FRIENDSHIP OF THAT NOBLE PAIR,SIR LUCIUS CARY AND SIR H.\n\nMORISON", "period": "Caroline", "literary_movement": "Classical Revival", "register": "Formal", "rhetorical_genre": "Epideictic", "discursive_structure": "Monologue", "discourse_type": "Poetic", "narrative_level": "Extradiegetic", "diegetic_mimetic": NaN, "focalization": "Third person (omniscient)", "person": NaN, "deictic_orientation": NaN, "addressee_type": "General", "deictic_object": NaN, "temporal_orientation": "Past", "temporal_structure": "Linear", "tradition": "English Literary Tradition", "mode": "Narrative", "genre": "Ode", "stanza_structure": "Irregular", "meter": "Iambic pentameter", "rhyme": "AABBCCDD"}

love,\nDrawes thee from caring what this world can yield;\nOf joyes and griefes both equall thou dost prove,\nThey have no force, to force thee from the field:\nThy constant faith like to the Turtle Dove\nContinues combat, and will never yield\nTo base affliction; or prowd pomps desire,\nThat sets the weakest mindes so much on fire.\n\nThou from the Court to the Countrie art retir'd,\nLeaving the world, before the world leaves thee:\nThat great Enchantresse of weake mindes admir'd,\nWhose all-bewitching charmes so pleasing be\nTo worldly wantons; and too much desir'd\nOf those that care not for Eternitie:\nBut yeeld themselves as preys to Lust and Sinne,\nLoosing their hopes of Heav'n Hell paines to winne.\n\nBut thou, the wonder of our wanton age\nLeav'st all delights to serve a heav'nly King:\nWho is more wise?\n\nor who can be more sage,\nThan she that doth Affection subject bring;\nNot forcing for the world, or Satans rage,\nBut shrowding under the Almighties wing;\nSpending her yeares, moneths, daies,\nminutes, howres,\nIn doing service to the heav'nly powres.\n\nThou faire example, live without compare,\nWith Honours triumphs seated in thy breast;\nPale Envy never can thy name empaire,\nWhen in thy heart thou harbour'st such a guest:\nMalice must live for ever in dispaire;\nThere's no revenge where Virtue still doth rest:\nAll hearts must needs do homage unto thee,\nIn whom all eies such rare perfection see.\n\nThat outward Beautie which the world commends,\nIs not the subject I will write upon,\nWhose date expir'd, that tyrant Time soone ends,\nThose gawdie colours soone are spent and gone: unaccompanied\nBut those faire Virtues which on thee attends with virtue.\n\nAre alwaies fresh, they never are but one:\nThey make thy Beautie fairer to behold,\nThan was that Queenes for whom prowd Troy\nwas sold.\n\nAs for those matchlesse colours Red and White,\nOr perfit features in a fading face,\nOr due proportion pleasing to the sight;\nAll these doe draw but dangers and disgrace:\nA mind enrich'd with Virtue, shines more bright,\nAddes everlasting Beauty, gives true grace,\nFrames an immortall Goddesse on the earth,\nWho though she dies, yet Fame gives her new berth.\n\nThat pride of Nature which adornes the faire,\nLike blasing Comets to allure all eies,\nIs but the thred, that weaves their web of Care,\nWho glories most, where most their danger lies;\nFor greatest perills do attend the faire,\nWhen men do seeke, attempt, plot and devise,\nHow they may overthrow the chastest Dame,\nWhose Beautie is the White whereat they aime.\n\nTwas Beautie bred in Troy the ten yeares strife,\nAnd carried Hellen from her lawfull Lord;\nTwas Beautie made chaste Lucrece loose her life,\nFor which prowd Tarquins fact was

with Majestie agree?\n\nTo staine thy blood, and blot thy royall name.\n\nThat heart that gave consent unto this ill,\nDid give consent that thou thy selfe should'st kill.\n\nFaire Rosamund, the wonder of her time,\nHad bin much fairer, had shee not bin faire;\nBeautie betraid her thoughts, aloft to clime,\nTo build strong castles in uncertaine aire,\nWhere th'infection of a wanton crime\nDid worke her fall; first poyson, then despaire,\nWith double death did kill her perjur'd soule,\nWhen heavenly Justice did her sinne controule.\n\nHoly Matilda in a haplesse houre Of Matilda.\n\nWas borne to sorow and to discontent,\nBeauty the cause that turn'd her Sweet to Sowre,\nWhile Chastity sought Folly to prevent.\n\nLustfull King John refus'd, did use his powre,\nBy Fire and Sword, to compasse his content:\nBut Friends disgrace, nor Fathers banishment,\nNor Death it selfe, could purchase her consent.\n\nHere Beauty in the height of all perfection,\nCrown'd this faire Creatures everlasting fame,\nWhose noble minde did scorne the base subjection\nOf Feares, or Favours, to impaire her Name:\nBy heavenly grace, she had such true direction,\nTo die with Honour, not to live in Shame;\nAnd drinke that poyson with a cheerefull heart,\nThat could all Heavenly grace to her impart.\n\nThis Grace great Lady, doth possesse thy Soule,\nAnd makes thee pleasing in thy Makers sight;\nThis Grace doth all imperfect Thoughts controule, the Introduction\nDirecting thee to serve thy God aright; to the passion\nStill reckoning him, the Husband of thy Soule, of Christ.\n\nWhich is most pretious in his glorious sight:\nBecause the Worlds delights shee doth denie\nFor him, who for her sake vouchsaf'd to die.\n\nAnd dying made her Dowager of all;\nNay more, Co-heire of that eternall blisse\nThat Angels lost, and We by Adams fall;\nMeere Cast-awaies, rais'd by a Judas kisse,\nChrists bloody sweat, the Vineger, and Gall,\nThe Speare, Sponge, Nailes, his buffeting with Fists,\nHis bitter Passion, Agony, and Death,\nDid gaine us Heaven when He did loose his breath.\n\nThese high deserts invites my lowely Muse\nTo write of Him, and pardon crave of thee,\nFor Time so spent, I need make no excuse, before\nKnowing it doth with thy faire Minde agree the Passion.\n\nSo well, as thou no Labour wilt refuse,\nThat to thy holy Love may pleasing be:\nHis Death and Passion I desire to write,\nAnd thee to reade, the blessed Soules delight.\n\nBut my deare Muse, now whither wouldst thou flie,\nAbove the pitch of thy appointed straine?\n\nWith Icarus thou seekest now to trie,\nNot waxen wings, but thy poore barren Braine,\nWhich farre too weake, these siely lines descrie;\nYet cannot this thy forward Mind restraine,\nBut thy poore Infant Verse must soare aloft,\nNot fearing threat'ning dangers, happening oft.\n\nThinke when the eye of Wisdom shall discover\nThy weakling Muse to flie, that scarce could creepe,\nAnd in the Ayre above the Clowdes to hover,\nWhen better \u2018twere mued up, and fast asleepe;\nThey'l thinke with Phaeton, thou canst neare recover,\nBut helplesse with that poore yong Lad to weepe:\nThe little World of thy weake Wit on fire,\nWhere thou wilt perish in thine owne desire.\n\nBut yet the Weaker thou doest seeme to be\nIn Sexe, or Sence, the more his Glory shines,\nThat doth infuze such powerfull Grace in thee,\nTo shew thy Love in these few humble Lines;\nThe Widowes Myte, with this may well agree,\nHer little All more worth than golden mynes,\nBeeing more deerer to our loving Lord,\nThan all the wealth that Kingdoms could affoard.\n\nTherefore I humbly for his Grace will pray,\nThat he will give me Power and Strength to Write,\nThat what I have begun, so end I may,\nAs his great Glory may appeare more bright;\nYea in these Lines I may no further stray,\nThan his most holy Spirit shall give me Light:\nThat blindest Weakenesse be not over-bold,\nThe manner of his Passion to unfold.\n\nIn other Phrases than may well agree\nWith his pure Doctrine, and most holy Writ,\nThat Heavens cleare eye, and all the World may see,\nI seeke his Glory, rather than to get\nThe Vulgars breath, the seed of Vanitie,\nNor Fames lowd Trumpet care I to admit;\nBut rather strive in plainest Words to showe,\nThe Matter which I seeke to undergoe.\n\nA Matter farre beyond my barren skill,\nTo shew with any Life this map of Death,\nThis Storie; that whole Worlds with Bookes would fill,\nIn these few Lines, will put me out of breath,\nTo run so swiftly up this mightie Hill,\nI may behold it with the eye of Faith;\nBut to present this pure unspotted Lambe,\nI must confesse, I farre unworthy am.\n\nYet if he please t'illuminate my Spirit,\nAnd give me Wisdom from his holy Hill,\nThat I may Write part of his glorious Merit,\nIf he vouchsafe to guide my Hand and Quill,\nTo shew his Death, by which we doe inherit\nThose endlesse Joyes that all our hearts doe fill;\nThen will I tell of that sad blacke fac'd Night,\nWhose mourning Mantle covered Heavenly Light.\n\nThat very Night our Saviour was betrayed, Here begins\nOh night! exceeding all the nights of sorow\nWhen our most blessed Lord, although dismayed,.\n\nYet would not he one Minutes respite borrow,\nBut to Mount Olives went, though sore afraid,\nTo welcome Night, and entertaine the Morrow;\nAnd as he oft unto that place did goe,\nSo did he now, to meete his long nurst woe.\n\nHe told his deere Disciples that they all\nShould be offended by him, that selfe night,\nHis Griefe was great, and theirs could not be small,\nTo part from him who was their sole Delight;\nSaint Peter thought his Faith could never fall,\nNo mote could happen in so cleare a sight:\nWhich made him say, though all men\nwere offended,\nYet would he never, though his life were ended.\n\nBut his deare Lord made answere, That before\nThe Cocke did crowe, he should deny him thrice;\nThis could not choose but grieve him very sore,\nThat his hot Love should proove more cold than Ice,\nDenying him he did so much adore;\nNo imperfection in himselfe he spies,\nBut faith againe, with him hee'l surely die,\nRather than his deare Master once denie.\n\nAnd all the rest (did likewise say the same)\nOf his Disciples, at that instant time;\nBut yet poore Peter, he was most too blame,\nThat thought above them all, by Faith to clime;\nHis forward speech inflicted sinne and shame,\nWhen Wisdoms eyes did looke and checke his crime:\nWho did foresee, and told it him before,\nYet would he needs averre it more and more.\n\nNow went our Lord unto that holy place,\nSweet Gethsemaine hallowed by his presence,\nThat blessed Garden, which did now embrace\nHis holy corps, yet could make no defence\nAgainst those Vipers, objects of disgrace,\nWhich sought that pure eternall Love to quench:\nHere his Disciples willed he to stay,\nWhilst he went further, where he meant to pray.\n\nNone were admitted with their Lord to goe,\nBut Peter, and the sonnes of Zebed'us,\nTo them good Jesus opened all his woe,\nHe gave them leave his sorows to discusse,\nHis deepest griefes, he did not scorne to showe\nThese three deere friends, so much he did intrust:\nBeeing sorowfull, and overcharg'd with griefe,\nHe told it them, yet look'd for no reliefe.\n\nSweet Lord, how couldst thou thus to flesh and blood\nCommunicate thy griefe?\n\ntell of thy woes?\n\nThou knew'st they had no powre to doe thee good,\nBut were the cause thou must endure these blowes,\nBeeing the Scorpions bred in Adams mud,\nWhose poys'ned sinnes did worke among thy foes,\nTo re-ore-charge thy over-burd'ned soule,\nAlthough the sorowes now they doe condole.\n\nYet didst thou tell them of thy troubled state,\nOf thy Soules heavinesse unto the death,\nSo full of Love, so free wert thou from hate,\nTo bid them stay, whose sinnes did stop thy breath,\nWhen thou wert entring at so straite a gate,\nYea entring even into the doore of Death,\nThou bidst them tarry there, and watch with thee,\nWho from thy pretious blood-shed were not free.\n\nBidding them tarry, thou didst further goe,\nTo meet affliction in such gracefull sort,\nAs might moove pitie both in friend and foe,\nThy sorowes such, as none could them comport,\nSuch great Indurements who did ever know,\nWhen to th' Almighty thou didst make resort?\n\nAnd falling on thy face didst humbly pray,\nIf \u2018twere his Will that Cup might passe away.\n\nSaying, Not my will, but thy will Lord be done.\n\nWhen as thou prayedst an Angel did appeare\nFrom Heaven, to comfort thee Gods onely Sonne,\nThat thou thy Suffrings might'st the better beare,\nBeeing in an agony, thy glasse neere run,\nThou prayedst more earnestly, in so great feare,\nThat pretious sweat came trickling to the ground,\nLike drops of blood thy sences to confound.\n\nLoe here his Will, not thy Will, Lord was done,\nAnd thou content to undergoe all paines,\nSweet Lambe of God, his deare beloved Sonne,\nBy this great purchase, what to thee remaines?\n\nOf Heaven and Earth thou hast a Kingdom wonne,\nThy Glory beeing equall with thy Gaines,\nIn ratifying Gods promise on the Earth,\nMade many hundred yeares before thy birth.\n\nBut now returning to thy sleeping Friends,\nThat could not watch one houre for love of thee,\nEven those three Friends, which on thy Grace depends,\nYet shut those Eies that should their Maker see;\nWhat colour, what excuse, or what amends,\nFrom thy Displeasure now can set them free?\n\nYet thy pure Pietie bids them Watch and Pray,\nLest in Temptation they be led away.\n\nAlthough the Spirit was willing to obay,\nYet what great weakenesse in the Flesh was found!\nThey slept in Ease, whilst thou in Paine didst pray;\nLoe, they in Sleepe, and thou in Sorow drown'd:\nYet Gods right Hand was unto thee a stay,\nWhen horror, griefe, and sorow did abound:\nHis Angel did appeare from Heaven to thee,\nTo yeeld thee comfort in Extremitie.\n\nBut what could comfort then thy troubled Minde,\nWhen Heaven and Earth were both against thee bent?\n\nAnd thou no hope, no ease, no rest could'st finde,\nBut must restore that Life, which was but lent;\nWas ever Creature in the World so kinde,\nBut he that from Eternitie was sent?\n\nTo satisfie for many Worlds of Sinne,\nWhose matchlesse Torments did but then begin.\n\nIf one Mans sinne doth challendge Death and Hell,\nWith all the Torments that belong thereto:\nIf for one sinne such Plagues on David fell,\nAs grieved him, and did his Seed undoe:\nIf Salomon, for that he did not well,\nFalling from Grace, did loose his Kingdome too:\nAnd Sinne the Cause that they were all undone.\n\nWhat could thy Innocency now expect,\nWhen all the Sinnes that ever were committed,\nWere laid to thee, whom no man could detect?\n\nYet farre thou wert of Man from beeing pittied,\nThe Judge so just could yeeld thee no respect,\nNor would one jot of penance be remitted;\nBut greater horror to thy Soule must rise,\nThan Heart can thinke, or any Wit devise.\n\nNow drawes the houre of thy affliction neere,\nAnd ugly Death presents himselfe before thee;\nThou now must leave those Friends thou held'st so deere,\nYea those Disciples, who did most adore thee;\nYet in thy countenance doth no Wrath appeare,\nAlthough betrayd to those that did abhorre thee:\nThou did'st vouchsafe to visit them againe,\nWho had no apprehension of thy paine.\n\nTheir eyes were heavie, and their hearts asleepe,\nNor knew they well what answere then to make thee;\nYet thou as Watchman, had'st a care to keepe\nThose few from sinne, that shortly would forsake thee;\nBut now thou bidst them henceforth Rest and Sleepe,\nThy houre is come, and they at hand to take thee:\nThe Sonne of God to Sinners made a pray,\nOh hatefull houre! oh blest! oh cursed day!\nLoe here thy great Humility was found,\nBeeing King of Heaven, and Monarch of the Earth,\nYet well content to have thy Glory drownd,\nBy beeing counted of so meane a berth;\nGrace, Love, and Mercy did so much abound,\nThou entertaindst the Crosse, even to the death:\nAnd nam'dst thy selfe, the sonne of Man to be,\nTo purge our pride by thy Humilitie.\n\nBut now thy friends whom thou didst call to goe,\nHeavy Spectators of thy haplesse case,\nSee thy Betrayer, whom too well they knowe,\nOne of the twelve, now object of disgrace,\nA trothlesse traytor, and a mortall foe,\nWith fained kindnesse seekes thee to imbrace;\nAnd gives a kisse, whereby he may deceive thee,\nThat in the hands of Sinners he might leave thee.\n\nNow muster forth with Swords, with Staves, with Bils,\nHigh Priests and Scribes, and Elders of the Land,\nSeeking by force to have their wicked Wils,\nWhich thou didst never purpose to withstand;\nNow thou mak'st haste unto the worst of Ils,\nAnd who they seeke, thou gently doest demand;\nThis didst thou Lord, t'amaze these Fooles the more,\nT'inquire of that, thou knew'st so well before.\n\nWhen loe these Monsters did not shame to tell,\nHis name they sought, and found, yet could not know\nJesus of Nazareth, at whose feet they fell,\nWhen Heavenly Wisdome did descend so lowe\nTo speake to them: they knew they did not well,\nTheir great amazement made them backeward goe:\nNay, though he said unto them, I am he,\nThey could not know him, whom their eyes did see.\n\nHow blinde were they could not discerne the Light!\nHow dull! if not to understand the truth,\nHow weake! if meekenesse overcame their might;\nHow stony hearted, if not mov'd to ruth:\nHow void of Pitie, and how full of Spight,\nGainst him that was the Lord of Light and Truth:\nHere insolent Boldnesse checkt by Love and Grace,\nRetires, and falls before our Makers face.\n\nFor when he spake to this accursed crew,\nAnd mildely made them know that it was he:\nPresents himselfe, that they might take a view;\nAnd what they doubted they might cleerely see;\nNay more, to re-assure that it was true,\nHe said: I say unto you, I am hee.\n\nIf him they sought, he's willing to obay,\nOnely desires the rest might goe their way.\n\nThus with a heart prepared to endure\nThe greatest wrongs Impietie could devise,\nHe was content to stoope unto their Lure,\nAlthough his Greatnesse might doe otherwise:\nHere Grace was seised on with hands impure,\nAnd Virtue now must be supprest by Vice,\nPure Innocencie made a prey to Sinne,\nThus did his Torments and our Joyes beginne.\n\nHere faire Obedience shined in his breast,\nAnd did suppresse all feare of future paine;\nLove was his Leader unto this unrest,\nWhil'st Righteousnesse doth carry up his Traine;\nMercy made way to make us highly blest,\nWhen Patience beat downe Sorrow, Feare and Paine:\nJustice sate looking with an angry brow,\nOn blessed misery appeering now.\n\nMore glorious than all the Conquerors\nThan ever liv'd within this Earthly round,\nMore powrefull than all Kings, or Governours\nThat ever yet within this World were found;\nMore valiant than the greatest Souldiers\nThat ever fought, to have their glory crown'd:\nFor which of them, that ever yet tooke breath,\nSought t'indure the doome of Heaven and Earth?\n\nBut our sweet Saviour whom these Jewes did name;\nYet could their learned Ignorance apprehend\nNo light of grace, to free themselves from blame:\nZeale, Lawes, Religion, now they doe pretend\nAgainst the truth, untruths they seeke to frame:\nNow al their powres, their wits, their strengths,\nthey bend\nAgainst one siely, weake, unarmed man,\nWho no resistance makes, though much he can,\nTo free himselfe from these unlearned men,\nWho call'd him Saviour in his blessed name;\nYet farre from knowing him their Saviour then,\nThat came to save both them and theirs from blame;\nThough they retire and fall, they come agen\nTo make a surer purchase of their shame:\nWith lights and torches now they find the way,\nTo take the Shepheard whilst the sheep doe stray.\n\nWhy should unlawfull actions use the Light?\n\nInniquitie in Darkenesse seekes to dwell;\nSinne rides his circuit in the dead of Night,\nTeaching all soules the ready waies to hell;\nSathan coms arm'd with all the powres of Spight,\nHeartens his Champions, makes them rude and fell;\nLike rav'ning wolves, to shed his guiltlesse blood,\nWho thought no harme, but di'd to doe them good.\n\nHere Falshood beares the shew of formall Right,\nBase Treacherie hath gote a guard of men;\nTyranny attends, with all his strength and might,\nTo leade this siely Lamb to Lyons denne;\nYet he unmoov'd in this most wretched plight,\nGoes on to meete them, knowes the houre, and when:\nThe powre of darkenesse must expresse Gods ire,\nTherefore to save these few was his desire.\n\nThese few that wait on Poverty and Shame,\nAnd offer to be sharers in his Ils;\nThese few that will be spreaders of his Fame,\nHe will not leave to Tyrants wicked wils\nBut still desires to free them from all blame,\nYet Feare goes forward, Anger Patience kils:\nA Saint is mooved to revenge a wrong,\nAnd Mildnesse doth what doth to Wrath belong.\n\nFor Peter griev'd at what might then befall,\nYet knew not what to doe, nor what to thinke,\nThought something must be done; now, if at all,\nTo free his Master, that he might not drinke\nThis poys'ned draught, farre bitterer than gall,\nFor now he sees him at the very brinke\nOf griesly Death, who gins to shew his face,\nClad in all colours of a deepe disgrace.\n\nAnd now those hands, that never us'd to fight,\nOr drawe a weapon in his owne defence,\nToo forward is, to doe his Master right,\nSince of his wrongs, hee feeles so true a sence:\nBut ah poore Peter! now thou wantest might,\nAnd hee's resolv'd, with them he will goe hence:\nTo draw thy sword in such a helpelesse cause,\nOffends thy Lord, and is against the Lawes.\n\nSo much he hates Revenge, so farre from Hate,\nThat he vouchsafes to heale, whom thou dost wound;\nHis paths are Peace, with none he holdes Debate,\nHis Patience stands upon so sure a ground,\nTo counsell thee, although it comes too late:\nNay, to his foes, his mercies so abound,\nThat he in pitty doth thy will restraine,\nAnd heales the hurt, and takes away the paine.\n\nFor willingly he will endure this wrong,\nAlthough his pray'rs might have obtain'd such grace,\nAs to dissolve their plots though ne'r so strong,\nAnd bring these wicked Actors in worse case\nThan \u00c6gypts King on whom Gods plagues did throng,\nBut that foregoing Scriptures must take place:\nIf God by prayers had an army sent\nOf powrefull Angels, who could them prevent?\n\nYet mightie JESUS meekely ask'd, Why they\nWith Swords and Staves doe come as to a Thiefe?\n\nHee teaching in the Temple day by day\nNone did offend, or give him cause of griefe.\n\nNow all are forward, glad is he that may\nGive most offence, and yeeld him least reliefe:\nHis hatefull foes are ready now to take him,\nAnd all his deere Disciples do forsake him.\n\nThose deare Disciples that he most did love,\nAnd were attendant at his becke and call,\nWhen triall of affliction came to prove,\nThey first left him, who now must leave them all:\nFor they were earth, and he came from above,\nWhich made them apt to flie, and fit to fall:\nThough they protest they never will forsake him,\nThey do like men, when dangers overtake them.\n\nAnd he alone is bound to loose us all,\nWhom with unhallowed hands they led along,\nTo wicked Caiphas in the Judgement Hall,\nWho studies onely how to doe him wrong;\nHigh Priests and Elders, People great and small,\nWith all reprochfull words about him throng:\nFalse Witnesses are now call'd in apace,\nWhose trothlesse tongues must make pale\ndeath imbrace\nThe beauty of the World, Heavens chiefest Glory;\nThe mirrour of Martyrs, Crowne of holy Saints;\nLove of th'Almighty, blessed Angels story;\nWater of Life, which none that drinks it, faints;\nGuide of the Just, where all our Light we borrow;\nMercy of Mercies; Hearer of Complaints;\nTriumpher over Death; Ransomer of Sinne;\nFalsly accused: now his paines begin.\n\nTheir tongues doe serve him as a Passing bell,\nFor what they say is certainly beleeved;\nSo sound a tale unto the Judge they tell,\nThat he of Life must shortly be bereaved;\nTheir share of Heaven, they doe not care to sell,\nSo his afflicted Heart be throughly grieved:\nThey tell his Words, though farre from his intent,\nAnd what his Speeches were, not what he meant.\n\nThat he Gods holy Temple could destroy,\nAnd in three daies could build it up againe;\nThis seem'd to them a vaine and idle toy,\nIt would not sinke into their sinful braine:\nChrists blessed body, al true Christians joy,\nShould die, and in three dayes revive againe:\nThis did the Lord of Heaven and earth endure,\nUnjustly to be charg'd by tongues impure.\n\nAnd now they all doe give attentive eare,\nTo heare the answere, which he will not make;\nThe people wonder how he can forbeare,\nAnd these great wrongs so patiently can take;\nBut yet he answers not, nor doth he care,\nMuch more he will endure for our sake:\nNor can their wisdoms any way discover,\nWho he should be that proov'd so true a Lover.\n\nTo entertaine the sharpest pangs of death,\nAnd fight a combate in the depth of hell,\nFor wretched Worldlings made of dust and earth,\nWhose hard'ned hearts, with pride and mallice swell;\nIn midst of bloody sweat, and dying breath,\nHe had compassion on these tyrants fell:\nAnd purchast them a place in Heav'n for ever,\nWhen they his Soule and Body sought to sever.\n\nSinnes ugly mists, so blinded had their eyes,\nThat at Noone dayes they could discerne no Light;\nThese were those fooles, that thought themselves so wise,\nThe Jewish wolves, that did our Saviour bite;\nFor now they use all meanes they can devise,\nTo beate downe truth, and goe against all right:\nYea now they take Gods holy name in vaine,\nTo know the truth, which truth they doe prophane.\n\nThe chiefest Hel-hounds of this hatefull crew,\nRose up to aske what answere he could make,\nAgainst those false accusers in his view;\nThat by his speech, they might advantage take:\nHe held his peace, yet knew they said not true,\nNo answere would his holy wisdome make,\nTill he was charged in his glorious name,\nWhose pleasure \u2018twas he should endure this shame.\n\nThen with so mild a Majestie he spake,\nAs they might easly know from whence he came,\nHis harmelesse tongue doth no exceptions take,\nNor Priests, nor People, meanes he now to blame;\nBut answers Folly, for true Wisdomes sake,\nBeeing charged deeply by his powrefull name,\nTo tell if Christ the Sonne of God he be,\nWho for our sinnes must die, to set us free.\n\nTo thee O Caiphas doth he answere give,\nThat thou hast said, what thou desir'st to know,\nAnd yet thy malice will not let him live,\nSo much thou art unto thy selfe a foe;\nHe speaketh truth, but thou wilt not beleeve,\nNor canst thou apprehend it to be so:\nThough he expresse his Glory unto thee,\nThy Owly eies are blind, and cannot see.\n\nThou rend'st thy\u00b0 cloathes, in stead of thy false heart,\nAnd on the guiltlesse lai'st thy guilty crime;\nFor thou blasphem'st, and he must feele the smart:\nTo sentence death, thou think'st it now high time;\nNo witnesse now thou need'st, for this fowle part,\nThou to the height of wickednesse canst clime:\nAnd give occasion to the ruder sort,\nTo make afflictions, sorrows, follies sport.\n\nNow when the dawne of day gins to appeare,\nAnd all your wicked counsels have an end,\nTo end his Life, that holds you all so deere,\nFor to that purpose did your studies bend;\nProud Pontius Pilate must the matter heare,\nTo your untroths his eares he now must lend:\nSweet Jesus bound, to him you led away,\nOf his most pretious blood to make your pray.\n\nWhich, when that wicked Caytife did perceive,\nBy whose lewd meanes he came to this distresse;\nHe brought the price of blood he did receive,\nThinking thereby to make his fault seeme lesse,\nAnd with these Priests and Elders did it leave,\nConfest his fault, wherein he did transgresse:\nBut when he saw Repentance unrespected,\nHe hang'd himselfe; of God and Man rejected.\n\nBy this Example, what can be expected\nFrom wicked Man, which on the Earth doth live?\n\nBut faithlesse dealing, feare of God neglected;\nWho for their private gaine cares not to sell\nThe Innocent Blood of Gods most deere elected,\nAs did that caytife wretch, now damn'd in Hell:\nIf in Christs Schoole, he tooke so great a fall,\nWhat will they doe, that come not there at all.\n\nNow Pontius Pilate is to judge the Cause\nOf faultlesse Jesus, who before him stands;\nWho neither hath offended Prince, nor Lawes,\nAlthough he now be brought in woefull bands:\nO noble Governour, make thou yet a pause,\nDoe not in innocent blood imbrue thy hands;\nBut heare the words of thy most worthy wife,\nWho sends to thee, to beg her Saviours life.\n\nLet barb'rous crueltie farre depart from thee,\nAnd in true Justice take afflictions part;\nOpen thine eies, that thou the truth mai'st see,\nDoe not the thing that goes against thy heart,\nCondemne not him that must thy Saviour be;\nBut view his holy Life, his good desert.\n\nLet not us Women glory in Mens fall,\nWho had power given to over-rule us all.\n\nTill now your indiscretion sets us free, Eves Apologie.\n\nAnd makes our former fault much lesse appeare;\nOur Mother Eve, who tasted of the Tree,\nGiving to Adam what shee held most deare,\nWas simply good, and had no powre to see,\nThe after-comming harme did not appeare:\nThe subtile Serpent that our Sex betraide,\nBefore our fall so sure a plot had laide.\n\nThat undiscerning Ignorance perceav'd\nNo guile, or craft that was by him intended;\nFor had she knowne, of what we were bereav'd,\nTo his request she had not condiscended.\n\nBut she (poore soule) by cunning was deceav'd,\nNo hurt therein her harmelesse Heart intended:\nFor she alleadg'd Gods word, which he denies,\nThat they should die, but even as Gods, be wise.\n\nBut surely Adam can not be excusde,\nHer fault though great, yet hee was most too blame;\nWhat Weaknesse offerd, Strength might have refusde,\nBeing Lord of all, the greater was his shame:\nAlthough the Serpents craft had her abusde,\nGods holy word ought all his actions frame,\nFor he was Lord and King of all the earth,\nBefore poore Eve had either life or breath.\n\nWho being fram'd by Gods eternall hand,\nThe perfect'st man that ever breath'd on earth;\nAnd from Gods mouth receiv'd that strait command,\nThe breach whereof he knew was present death:\nYea having powre to rule both Sea and Land,\nYet with one Apple wonne to loose that breath\nWhich God had breathed in his beauteous face,\nBringing us all in danger and disgrace.\n\nAnd then to lay the fault on Patience backe,\nThat we (poore women) must endure it all;\nWe know right well he did discretion lacke,\nBeeing not perswaded thereunto at all;\nIf Eve did erre, it was for knowledge sake,\nThe fruit beeing faire perswaded him to fall:\nNo subtill Serpents falshood did betray him,\nIf he would eate it, who had powre to stay him?\n\nNot Eve, whose fault was onely too much love,\nWhich made her give this present to her Deare,\nThat what shee tasted, he likewise might prove,\nWhereby his knowledge might become more cleare;\nHe never sought her weakenesse to reprove,\nWith those sharpe words, which he of God did heare:\nYet Men will boast of Knowledge, which he tooke\nFrom Eves faire hand, as from a learned Booke.\n\nIf any Evill did in her remaine,\nBeeing made of him, he was the ground of all;\nIf one of many Worlds could lay a staine\nUpon our Sexe, and worke so great a fall\nTo wretched Man, by Satans subtill traine;\nWhat will so fowle a fault amongst you all?\n\nHer weakenesse did the Serpents words obay;\nBut you in malice Gods deare Sonne betray.\n\nWhom, if unjustly you condemne to die,\nHer sinne was small, to what you doe commit;\nAll mortall sinnes that doe for vengeance crie,\nAre not to be compared unto it:\nIf many worlds would altogether trie,\nBy all their sinnes the wrath of God to get;\nThis sinne of yours, surmounts them all as farre\nAs doth the Sunne, another little starre,\nThen let us have our Libertie againe,\nAnd challendge to your selves no Sov'raigntie;\nYou came not in the world without our paine,\nMake that a barre against your crueltie;\nYour fault beeing greater, why should you disdaine\nOur beeing your equals, free from tyranny?\n\nIf one weake woman simply did offend,\nThis sinne of yours, hath no excuse, nor end.\n\nTo which (poore soules) we never gave consent,\nWitnesse thy wife (O Pilate) speakes for all;\nWho did but dreame, and yet a message sent,\nThat thou should'st have nothing to doe at all\nWith that just man; which, if thy heart relent,\nWhy wilt thou be a reprobate with Saul?\n\nTo seeke the death of him that is so good,\nFor thy soules health to shed his dearest blood.\n\nYea, so thou mai'st these sinful people please,\nThou art content against all truth and right,\nTo seale this act, that may procure thine ease\nWith blood, and wrong, with tyrannie, and might;\nThe multitude thou seekest to appease,\nBy base dejection of this heavenly Light:\nDemanding which of these that thou should'st loose,\nWhether the Thiefe, or Christ King of the Jewes.\n\nBase Barrabas the Thiefe, they all desire,\nAnd thou more base than he, perform'st their will;\nYet when thy thoughts backe to themselves retire,\nThou art unwilling to commit this ill:\nOh that thou couldst unto such grace aspire,\nThat thy polluted lips might never kill\nThat Honour, which right Judgement ever graceth,\nTo purchase shame, which all true worth defaceth.\n\nArt thou a Judge, and asketh what to do\nWith one, in whom no fault there can be found?\n\nThe death of Christ wilt thou consent unto,\nFinding no cause, no reason, nor no ground?\n\nShall he be scourg'd, and crucified too?\n\nAnd must his miseries by thy meanes abound?\n\nYet not asham'd to aske what he hath done,\nWhen thine owne conscience seeks this sinne\nto shunne.\n\nThree times thou ask'st, What evill hath he done?\n\nAnd saist, thou find'st in him no cause of death,\nYet wilt thou chasten Gods beloved Sonne,\nAlthough to thee no word of ill he saith:\nFor Wrath must end, what Malice hath begunne,\nAnd thou must yield to stop his guiltlesse breath.\n\nThis rude tumultuous rowt doth presse so sore,\nThat thou condemnest him thou shouldst adore.\n\nYet Pilate, this can yeeld thee no content,\nTo exercise thine owne authoritie,\nBut unto Herod he must needes be sent,\nTo reconcile thy selfe by tyrannie:\nWas this the greatest good in Justice meant,\nWhen thou perceiv'st no fault in him to be?\n\nIf thou must make thy peace by Virtues fall,\nMuch better \u2018twere not to be friends at all.\n\nYet neither thy sterne browe, nor his great place,\nCan draw an answer from the Holy One:\nHis false accusers, nor his great disgrace,\nNor Herods scoffes; to him they are all one:\nHe neither cares, nor feares his owne ill case,\nThough being despis'd and mockt of every one:\nKing Herods gladnesse gives him little ease,\nNeither his anger seekes he to appease.\n\nYet this is strange, that base Impietie\nShould yeeld those robes of honour, which were due;\nPure white, to shew his great Integritie,\nHis innocency, that all the world might view;\nPerfections height in lowest penury,\nSuch glorious poverty as they never knew:\nPurple and Scarlet well might him beseeme,\nWhose pretious blood must all the world redeeme.\n\nAnd that Imperiall Crowne of Thornes he wore,\nWas much more pretious than the Diadem\nOf any King that ever liv'd before,\nOr since his time, their honour's but a dreame\nTo his eternall glory, beeing so poore,\nTo make a purchasse of that heavenly Realme;\nWhere God with all his Angels lives in peace,\nNo griefes, nor sorrowes, but all joyes increase.\n\nThose royall robes, which they in scorne did give,\nTo make him odious to the common sort,\nYeeld light of Grace to those whose soules shall live\nWithin the harbour of this heavenly port;\nMuch doe they joy, and much more doe they grieve,\nHis death, their life, should make his foes such sport:\nWith sharpest thornes to pricke his blessed face,\nOur joyfull sorrow, and his greater grace.\n\nThree feares at once possessed Pilates heart;\nThe first, Christs innocencie, which so plaine appeares;\nThe next, That he which now must feele this smart,\nIs Gods deare Sonne, for any thing he heares:\nBut that which proov'd the deepest wounding dart,\nIs Peoples threat'nings, which he so much feares,\nThat he to C\u00e6sar could not be a friend,\nUnlesse he sent sweet JESUS to his end.\n\nNow Pilate thou art proov'd a painted wall,\nA golden Sepulcher with rotten bones;\nFrom right to wrong, from equitie to fall:\nIf none upbraid thee, yet the very stones\nHis blood, his teares, his sighes, his bitter groanes:\nAll these will witnesse at the latter day,\nWhen water cannot wash thy sinne away.\n\nCanst thou be innocent, that gainst all right,\nWilt yeeld to what thy conscience doth withstand?\n\nBeeing a man of knowledge, powre, and might,\nTo let the wicked carrie such a hand,\nBefore thy face to blindfold Heav'ns bright light,\nAnd thou to yeeld to what they did demand?\n\nWashing thy hands, thy conscience cannot cleare,\nBut to all worlds this staine must needs appeare.\n\nFor loe, the Guiltie doth accuse the Just,\nAnd faultie Judge condemnes the Innocent;\nAnd wilfull Jewes to exercise their lust,\nWith whips and taunts against their Lord are bent;\nHe basely us'd, blasphemed, scorn'd, and curst,\nOur heavenly King to death for us they sent:\nReproches, slanders, spittings in his face,\nSpight doing all her worst in his disgrace.\n\nAnd now this long expected houre drawes neere,\nWhen blessed Saints with Angels doe condole;\nHis holy march, soft pace, and heavy cheere,\nIn humble sort to yeeld his glorious soule,\nBy his deserts the fowlest sinnes to cleare;\nAnd in th'eternall booke of heaven to enroule\nA satisfaction till the generall doome,\nOf all sinnes past, and all that are to come.\n\nThey that had seene this pitifull Procession,\nFrom Pilates Palace to Mount Calvarie,\nMight thinke he answer'd for some great transgression,\nBeeing in such odious sort condemn'd to die;\nHe plainely shewed that his own profession\nWas virtue, patience, grace, love, piety;\nAnd how by suffering he could conquer more\nThan all the Kings that ever liv'd before.\n\nFirst went the Crier with open mouth proclayming\nThe heavy sentence of Iniquitie,\nThe Hangman next, by his base office clayming\nHis right in Hell, where sinners never die,\nCarrying the nayles, the people still blaspheming\nTheir maker, using all impiety;\nThe Thieves attending him on either side,\nThe Serjeants watching, while the women cri'd.\n\nThe teares\nof the\nThrice happy women that obtaind such grace daughters\nFrom him whose worth the world could not containe.\n\nImmediately to turne about his face,\nAs not remembring his great griefe and paine,\nTo comfort you, whose teares powr'd forth apace\nOn Flora's bankes, like shewers of Aprils raine:\nYour cries inforced mercie, grace, and love\nFrom him, whom greatest Princes could not moove:\nTo speake on word, nor once to lift his eyes\nUnto proud Pilate, no nor Herod, king;\nBy all the Questions that they could devise,\nCould make him answere to no manner of thing;\nYet these poore women, by their pitious cries\nDid moove their Lord, their Lover, and their King,\nTo take compassion, turne about, and speake\nTo them whose hearts were ready now to breake.\n\nMost blessed daughters of Jerusalem,\nWho found such favour in your Saviors sight,\nTo turne his face when you did pitie him;\nYour tearefull eyes, beheld his eies more bright;\nYour Faith and Love unto such grace did clime,\nTo have reflection from this Heav'nly Light:\nYour Eagles eyes did gaze against this Sunne,\nYour hearts did thinke, he dead, the world were done.\n\nWhen spightfull men with torments did oppresse\nTh'afflicted body of this innocent Dove,\nPoore women seeing how much they did transgresse,\nBy teares, by sighes, by cries intreat,\nWhat may be done among the thickest presse,\nThey labour still these tyrants hearts to move;\nIn pitie and compassion to forbeare\nTheir whipping, spurning, tearing of his haire.\n\nBut all in vaine, their malice hath no end,\nTheir hearts more hard than flint, or marble stone;\nNow to his griefe, his greatnesse they attend,\nWhen he (God knowes) had rather be alone;\nThey are his guard, yet seeke all meanes to offend:\nWell may he grieve, well may he sigh and groane,\nUnder the burthen of a heavy crosse,\nHe faintly goes to make their gaine his losse.\n\nHis woefull Mother wayting on her Sonne,\nAll comfortlesse in depth of sorow drowned;\nHer griefes extreame, although but new begun,\nTo see his bleeding body oft shee swouned;\nHow could shee choose but thinke her selfe undone,\nHe dying, with whose glory shee was crowned?\n\nNone ever lost so great a losse as shee,\nBeeing Sonne, and Father of Eternitie.\n\nHer teares did wash away his pretious blood,\nThat sinners might not tread it under feet\nTo worship him, and that it did her good\nUpon her knees, although in open street,\nKnowing he was the Jessie floure and bud,\nThat must be gath'red when it smell'd most sweet:\nHer Sonne, her Husband, Father, Saviour, King,\nWhose death killd Death, and tooke away his sting.\n\nMost blessed Virgin, in whose faultlesse fruit,\nAll Nations of the earth must needes rejoyce,\nNo Creature having sence though ne'r so brute,\nBut joyes and trembles when they heare his voyce;\nHis wisedome strikes the wisest persons mute,\nFaire chosen vessell, happy in his choyce:\nDeere Mother of our Lord, whose reverend name,\nAll people Blessed call, and spread thy fame.\n\nFor the Almightie magnified thee,\nAnd looked downe upon thy meane estate;\nThy lowly mind, and unstain'd Chastitie\nDid pleade for Love at great Jehovaes gate,\nWho sending swift-wing'd Gabriel unto thee,\nHis holy will and pleasure to relate;\nTo thee most beauteous Queene of Woman-kind,\nThe Angell did unfold his Makers mind.\n\nHe thus beganne, Haile Mary full of grace,\nThou freely art beloved of the Lord, of the Virgin\nHe is with thee, behold thy happy case; Marie.\n\nWhat endlesse comfort did these words afford\nTo thee that saw'st an Angell in the place\nProclaime thy Virtues worth, and to record\nThee blessed among women: that thy praise\nShould last so many worlds beyond thy daies.\n\nLoe, this high message to thy troubled spirit,\nHe doth deliver in the plainest sence;\nSayes, Thou shouldst beare a Sonne that shal inherit\nHis Father Davids throne, free from offence,\nCall's him that Holy thing, by whose pure merit\nWe must be sav'd, tels what he is, of whence;\nHis worth, his greatnesse, what his name must be,\nWho should be call'd the Sonne of the most High.\n\nHe cheeres thy troubled soule, bids thee not feare;\nWhen thy pure thoughts could hardly apprehend\nThis salutation, when he did appeare;\nNor couldst thou judge, whereto those words\ndid tend;\nHis pure aspect did moove thy modest cheere\nTo muse, yet joy that God vouchsaf'd to send\nHis glorious Angel; who did thee assure\nTo beare a child, although a Virgin pure.\n\nNay more, thy Sonne should Rule and Raigne\nfor ever;\nYea, of his Kingdom there should be no end;\nOver the house of Jacob, Heavens great Giver\nWould give him powre, and to that end did send\nHis faithfull servant Gabriel to deliver\nTo thy chast eares no word that might offend:\nBut that this blessed Infant borne of thee,\nThy Sonne, The onely Sonne of God should be.\n\nWhen on the knees of thy submissive heart\nThou humbly didst demand, How that should be?\n\nThy virgin thoughts did thinke, none could impart\nThis great good hap, and blessing unto thee;\nFarre from desire of any man thou art,\nKnowing not one, thou art from all men free:\nWhen he, to answere this thy chaste desire,\nGives thee more cause to wonder and admire.\n\nThat thou a blessed Virgin shoulst remaine,\nYea that the holy Ghost should come on thee\nA maiden Mother, subject to no paine,\nFor highest powre should overshadow thee:\nCould thy faire eyes from teares of joy refraine,\nWhen God look'd downe upon thy poore degree?\n\nMaking thee Servant, Mother, Wife, and Nurse\nTo Heavens bright King, that freed us from the curse.\n\nThus beeing crown'd with glory from above,\nGrace and Perfection resting in thy breast,\nThy humble answer doth approove thy Love,\nAnd all these sayings in thy heart doe rest:\nThy Child a Lambe, and thou a Turtle dove,\nAbove all other women highly blest;\nTo find such favour in his glorious sight,\nIn whom thy heart and soule doe most delight.\n\nWhat wonder in the world more strange could seeme,\nThan that a Virgin could conceive and beare\nWithin her wombe a Sonne, That should redeeme\nAll Nations on the earth, and should repaire\nOur old decaies: who in such high esteeme,\nShould prize all mortals, living in his feare;\nAs not to shun Death, Povertie, and Shame,\nTo save their soules, and spread his glorious Name.\n\nAnd partly to fulfil his Fathers pleasure,\nWhose powrefull hand allowes it not for strange,\nIf he vouchsafe the riches of his treasure,\nPure Righteousnesse to take such il exchange;\nOn all Iniquitie to make a seisure,\nGiving his snow-white Weed for ours in change;\nOur mortall garment in a skarlet Die,\nToo base a roabe for Immortalitie.\n\nMost happy news, that ever yet was brought,\nWhen Poverty and Riches met together,\nThe wealth of Heaven, in our fraile clothing wrought\nSalvation by his happy comming hither:\nMighty Messias, who so deerely bought\nUs Slaves to sinne, farre lighter than a feather:\nToss'd to and fro with every wicked wind,\nThe world, the flesh, or Devill gives to blind.\n\nWho on his shoulders our blacke sinnes doth beare\nTo that most blessed, yet accursed Crosse;\nWhere fastning them, he rids us of our feare,\nYea for our gaine he is content with losse,\nOur ragged clothing scornes he not to weare,\nThough foule, rent, torne, disgracefull, rough\nand grosse,\nSpunne by that monster Sinne, and weav'd by Shame,\nWhich grace it selfe, disgrac'd with impure blame.\n\nHow canst thou choose (faire Virgin) then but mourne,\nWhen this sweet of-spring of thy body dies,\nWhen thy faire eies beholds his bodie torne,\nThe peoples fury, heares the womens cries;\nHis holy name prophan'd, He made a scorne,\nAbusde with all their hatefull slaunderous lies:\nBleeding and fainting in such wondrous sort,\nAs scarce his feeble limbes can him support.\n\nNow Simon of Cyrene passeth them by,\nWhom they compell sweet JESUS Crosse to beare\nTo Golgatha, there doe they meane to trie\nAll cruell meanes to worke in him dispaire:\nThat odious place, where dead mens skulls did lie,\nThere must our Lord for present death prepare:\nHis sacred blood must grace that loathsome field,\nTo purge more filth, than that foule place could yield.\n\nFor now arriv'd unto this hatefull place,\nIn which his Crosse erected needes must bee,\nFalse hearts, and willing hands come on apace,\nAll prest to ill, and all desire to see:\nGracelesse themselves, still seeking to disgrace;\nBidding him, If the Sonne of God he bee,\nTo save himselfe, if he could others save,\nWith all th'opprobrious words that might deprave.\n\nHis harmelesse hands unto the Crosse they nailde,\nAnd feet that never trode in sinners trace,\nBetweene two theeves, unpitied, unbewailde,\nSave of some few possessors of his grace,\nWith sharpest pangs and terrors thus appailde,\nSterne Death makes way, that Life might give him place:\nHis eyes with teares, his body full of wounds,\nDeath last of paines his sorrows all confounds.\n\nHis joynts dis-joynted, and his legges hang downe,\nHis alablaster breast, his bloody side,\nHis members torne, and on his head a Crowne\nOf sharpest Thorns, to satisfie for pride:\nAnguish and Paine doe all his Sences drowne,\nWhile they his holy garments do divide:\nHis bowells drie, his heart full fraught with griefe,\nCrying to him that yeelds him no reliefe.\n\nThis with the eie of Faith thou maist behold,\nDeere Spouse of Christ, and more than I can write;\nAnd here both Griefe and Joy thou maist unfold,\nTo view thy Love in this most heavy plight,\nBowing his head, his bloodlesse body cold;\nThose eies waxe dimme that gave us all our light,\nHis count'nance pale, yet still continues sweet,\nHis blessed blood watring his pierced feet.\n\nO glorious miracle without compare!\nLast, but not least which was by him effected;\nUniting death, life, misery, joy and care,\nBy his sharpe passion in his deere elected:\nWho doth the Badges of like Liveries weare,\nShall find how deere they are of him respected.\n\nNo joy, griefe, paine, life, death, was like to his,\nWhose infinitie dolours wrought eternall blisse.\n\nWhat creature on the earth did then remaine,\nOn whom the horror of this shamefull deed all creatures\nDid not inflict some violent touch, or straine, at that\nTo see the Lord of all the world to bleed?\n\ninstant when\nHis dying breath did rend huge rockes in twaine, Christ died.\n\nThe heavens betooke them to their mourning weed:\nThe Sunne grew darke, and scorn'd to give\nthem light,\nWho durst ecclipse a glory farre more bright.\n\nThe Moone and Starres did hide themselves for shame,\nThe earth did tremble in her loyall feare,\nThe Temple vaile did rent to spread his fame,\nThe Monuments did open every where;\nDead Saints did rise forth of their graves, and came\nTo divers people that remained there\nWithin that holy City; whose offence,\nDid put their Maker to this large expence.\n\nThings reasonable, and reasonlesse possest\nThe terrible impression of this fact;\nFor his oppression made them all opprest,\nWhen with his blood he seal'd so faire an act,\nIn restlesse miserie to procure our rest;\nHis glorious deedes that dreadfull prison sackt:\nWhen Death, Hell, Divells, using all their powre,\nWere overcome in that most blessed houre.\n\nBeing dead, he killed Death, and did survive\nThat prowd insulting Tyrant: in whose place\nHe sends bright Immortalitie to revive\nThose whom his yron armes did long embrace;\nWho from their loathsome graves brings them alive\nIn glory to behold their Saviours face:\nWho tooke the keys of all Deaths powre away,\nOpening to those that would his name obay.\n\nO wonder, more than man can comprehend,\nOur Joy and Griefe both at one instant fram'd,\nCompounded: Contrarieties contend\nEach to exceed, yet neither to be blam'd.\n\nOur Griefe to see our Saviours wretched end,\nOur Joy to know both Death and Hell he tam'd:\nThat we may say, O Death, where is thy sting?\n\nHell, yeeld thy victory to thy conq'ring King.\n\nCan stony hearts refraine from shedding teares,\nTo view the life and death of this sweet Saint?\n\nHis austere course in yong and tender yeares,\nWhen great indurements could not make him faint:\nHis wants, his paines, his torments, and his feares,\nAll which he undertooke without constraint,\nTo shew that infinite Goodnesse must restore,\nWhat infinite Justice looked for, and more.\n\nYet, had he beene but of a meane degree,\nHis suffrings had beene small to what they were;\nMeane minds will shew of what meane mouldes\nthey bee; 1235\nSmall griefes seeme great, yet Use doth make them beare:\nBut ah! tis hard to stirre a sturdy tree;\nGreat dangers hardly puts great minds in feare:\nThey will conceale their griefes which mightie grow\nIn their stout hearts untill they overflow.\n\nIf then an earthly Prince may ill endure\nThe least of those afflictions which he bare,\nHow could this all-commaunding King procure\nSuch grievous torments with his mind to square,\nLegions of Angells being at his Lure?\n\nHe might have liv'd in pleasure without care:\nNone can conceive the bitter paines he felt,\nWhen God and man must suffer without guilt.\n\nTake all the Suffrings Thoughts can thinke upon,\nIn ev'ry man that this huge world hath bred;\nLet all those Paines and Suffrings meet in one,\nYet are they not a Mite to that he did\nEndure for us: Oh let us thinke thereon,\nThat God should have his pretious blood so shed:\nHis Greatnesse clothed in our fraile attire,\nAnd pay so deare a ransome for the hire.\n\nLoe, here was glorie, miserie, life and death,\nAn union of contraries did accord;\nGladnesse and sadnesse here had one berth,\nThis wonder wrought the Passion of our Lord,\nHe suffring for all the sinnes of all th'earth,\nNo satisfaction could the world afford:\nBut this rich Jewell, which from God was sent,\nTo call all those that would in time repent.\n\nWhich I present (deare Lady) to your view,\nUpon the Crosse depriv'd of life or breath,\nTo judge if ever Lover were so true,\nTo yeeld himselfe unto such shamefull death:\nNow blessed Joseph doth both beg and sue,\nTo have his body who possest his faith,\nAnd thinkes, if he this small request obtaines,\nHe wins more wealth than in the world remaines.\n\nThus honourable Joseph is possest,\nOf what his heart and soule so much desired,\nAnd now he goes to give that body rest,\nThat all his life, with griefes and paines was tired;\nHe finds a Tombe, a Tombe most rarely blest,\nIn which was never creature yet interred;\nThere this most pretious body he incloses,\nImbalmd and deckt with Lillies and with Roses.\n\nLoe here the Beautie of Heav'n and Earth is laid,\nThe purest coulers underneath the Sunne,\nBut in this place he cannot long be staid,\nGlory must end what horror hath begun;\nFor he the furie of the Heavens obay'd,\nAnd now he must possesse what he hath wonne:\nThe Maries doe with pretious balmes attend,\nBut beeing come, they find it to no end.\n\nFor he is rize from Death t'Eternall Life,\nAnd now those pretious oyntments he desires\nAre brought unto him, by his faithfull Wife\nThe holy Church; who in those rich attires,\nOf Patience, Love, Long suffring, Voide of strife,\nHumbly presents those oyntments he requires:\nThe oyles of Mercie, Charitie, and Faith,\nShee onely gives that which no other hath.\n\nThese pretious balmes doe heale his grievous wounds,\nAnd water of Compunction washeth cleane\nThe soares of sinnes, which in our Soules abounds;\nSo faire it heales, no skarre is ever seene;\nYet all the glory unto Christ redounds, Canticles.\n\nHis pretious blood is that which must redeeme;\nThose well may make us lovely in his sight,\nBut cannot save without his powrefull might.\n\nThis is that Bridegroome that appeares so faire,\nSo sweet, so lovely in his Spouses sight,\nThat unto Snowe we may his face compare,\nHis cheekes like skarlet, and his eyes so bright\nAs purest Doves that in the rivers are,\nWashed with milke, to give the more delight;\nHis head is likened to the finest gold,\nHis curled lockes so beauteous to behold;\nBlacke as a Raven in her blackest hew;\nHis lips like skarlet threeds, yet much more sweet\nThan is the sweetest hony dropping dew,\nOr hony combes, where all the Bees doe meet;\nYea, he is constant, and his words are true,\nHis cheekes are beds of spices, flowers sweet;\nHis lips like Lillies, dropping downe pure mirrhe,\nWhose love, before all worlds we doe preferre.\n\nAh! give me leave (good Lady) now to leave\nThis taske of Beauty which I tooke in hand,\nI cannot wade so deepe, I may deceave of Cumberland.\n\nMy selfe, before I can attaine the land;\nTherefore (good Madame) in your heart I leave\nHis perfect picture, where it still shall stand,\nDeepely engraved in that holy shrine,\nEnvironed with Love and Thoughts divine.\n\nThere may you see him as a God in glory,\nAnd as a man in miserable case;\nThere may you reade his true and perfect storie,\nHis bleeding body there you may embrace,\nAnd kisse his dying cheekes with teares of sorrow,\nWith joyfull griefe, you may intreat for grace;\nAnd all your prayers, and your almes-deeds\nMay bring to stop his cruell wounds that bleeds.\n\nOft times hath he made triall of your love,\nAnd in your Faith hath tooke no small delight,\nBy Crosses and Afflictions he doth prove,\nYet still your heart remaineth firme and right;\nYour love so strong, as nothing can remove,\nYour thoughts beeing placed on him both day\nand night,\nYour constant soule doth lodge betweene her brests,\nThis Sweet of sweets, in which all glory rests.\n\nSometime h'appeares to thee in Shepheards weed,\nAnd so presents himselfe before thine eyes,\nA good old man; that goes his flocke to feed;\nThy colour changes, and thy heart doth rise;\nThou call'st, he comes, thou find'st tis he indeed,\nThy Soule conceaves that he is truely wise:\nNay more, desires that he may be the Booke,\nWhereon thine eyes continually may looke.\n\nSometime imprison'd, naked, poore, and bare,\nFull of diseases, impotent, and lame,\nBlind, deafe, and dumbe, he comes unto his faire,\nTo see if yet shee will remaine the same;\nNay sicke and wounded, now thou do'st prepare\nTo cherish him in thy dear Lovers name:\nYea thou bestow'st all paines, all cost, all care,\nThat may relieve him, and his health repaire.\n\nThese workes of mercy are so sweete, so deare\nTo him that is the Lord of Life and Love,\nThat all thy prayers he vouchsafes to heare,\nAnd sends his holy Spirit from above;\nThy eyes are op'ned, and thou seest so cleare,\nNo worldly thing can thy faire mind remove;\nThy faith, thy prayers, and his speciall grace\nDoth open Heav'n, where thou behold'st his face.\n\nThese are those Keyes Saint Peter did possesse,\nWhich with a Spirituall powre are giv'n to thee,\nTo heale the soules of those that doe transgresse,\nBy thy faire virtues; which, if once they see,\nUnto the like they doe their minds addresse,\nSuch as thou art, such they desire to be:\nIf they be blind, thou giv'st to them their sight;\nIf deafe or lame, they heare, and goe upright.\n\nYea, if possest with any evill spirits,\nSuch powre thy faire examples have obtain'd\nTo cast them out, applying Christs pure merits,\nBy which they are bound, and of all hurt restrain'd:\nIf strangely taken, wanting sence or wits,\nThy faith appli'd unto their soules so pain'd,\nHealeth all griefes, and makes them grow so strong,\nAs no defects can hang upon them long.\n\nThou beeing thus rich, no riches do'st respect,\nNor do'st thou care for any outward showe;\nThe proud that doe faire Virtues rules neglect,\nDesiring place, thou sittest them belowe:\nAll wealth and honour thou do'st quite reject,\nIf thou perceiv'st that once it prooves a foe\nTo virtue, learning, and the powres divine,\nThou mai'st convert, but never wilt incline\nTo fowle disorder, or licentiousnesse\nBut in thy modest vaile do'st sweetly cover\nThe staines of other sinnes, to make themselves,\nThat by this meanes thou mai'st in time recover\nThose weake lost sheepe that did so long transgresse,\nPresenting them unto thy deerest Lover;\nThat when he brings them backe unto his fold,\nIn their conversion then he may behold\nThy beauty shining brighter than the Sunne,\nThine honour more than ever Monarke gaind,\nThy wealth exceeding his that Kingdomes wonne,\nThy Love unto his Spouse, thy Faith unfaind,\nThy Constancy in what thou hast begun,\nTill thou his heavenly Kingdom have obtaind;\nRespecting worldly wealth to be but drosse,\nWhich, if abuz'd, doth proove the owners losse.\n\nGreat Cleopatra's love to Anthony,\nCan no way be compared unto thine;\nShee left her Love in his extremitie,\nWhen greatest need should cause her to combine\nHer force with his, to get the Victory:\nHer Love was earthly, and thy Love Divine;\nHer Love was onely to support her pride,\nHumilitie thy Love and Thee doth guide.\n\nThat glorious part of Death, which last shee plai'd,\nT'appease the ghost of her deceased Love,\nHad never needed, if shee could have stai'd\nWhen his extreames made triall, and did prove\nHer leaden love unconstant, and afraid:\nTheir wicked warres the wrath of God might move\nTo take revenge for chast Octavia's wrongs,\nBecause shee enjoyes what unto her belongs.\n\nNo Cleopatra, though thou wert as faire\nAs any Creature in Antonius eyes;\nYea though thou wert as rich, as wise, as rare,\nAs any Pen could write, or Wit devise;\nYet with this Lady canst thou not compare,\nWhose inward virtues all thy worth denies:\nYet thou a blacke Egyptian do'st appeare;\nThou false, shee true; and to her Love more deere.\n\nShee sacrificeth to her deerest Love,\nWith flowres of Faith, and garlands of Good deeds;\nShee flies not from him when afflictions prove,\nShee beares his crosse, and stops his wounds that bleeds;\nShee love and lives chaste as the Turtle dove,\nShee attends upon him, and his flocke shee feeds;\nYea for one touch of death which thou did'st trie,\nA thousand deaths shee every day doth die.\n\nHer virtuous life exceeds thy worthy death,\nYea, she hath richer ornaments of state,\nShining more glorious than in dying breath\nThou didst; when either pride, or cruell fate,\nDid worke thee to prevent a double death;\nTo stay the malice, scorne, and cruell hate\nOf Rome; that joy'd to see thy pride pull'd downe,\nWhose Beauty wrought the hazard of her Crowne.\n\nGood Madame, though your modestie be such,\nNot to acknowledge what we know and find;\nAnd that you thinke these prayses overmuch,\nWhich doe expresse the beautie of your mind;\nYet pardon me although I give a touch\nUnto their eyes, that else would be so blind,\nAs not to see thy store, and their owne wants\nFrom whose faire seeds of Virtue spring\nthese plants.\n\nAnd knowe, when first into this world I came,\nThis charge was giv'n me by th'Eternall powres,\nTh'everlasting Trophie of thy fame,\nTo build and decke it with the sweetest flowres\nThat virtue yeelds; Then Madame, doe not blame\nMe, when I shew the World but what is yours,\nAnd decke you with that crowne which is your due,\nThat of Heav'ns beauty Earth may take a view.\n\nThough famous women elder times have knowne,\nWhose glorious actions did appeare so bright,\nThat powrefull men by them were overthrowne,\nAnd all their armies overcome in fight;\nThe Scythian women by their powre alone,\nPut king Darius unto shamefull flight:\nAll Asia yeelded to their conq'ring hand,\nGreat Alexander could not their powre withstand.\n\nWhose worth, though writ in lines of blood and fire,\nIs not to be compared unto thine;\nTheir powre was small to overcome Desire,\nOr to direct their wayes by Virtues line:\nWere they alive, they would thy Life admire,\nAnd unto thee their honours would resigne:\nFor thou a greater conquest do'st obtaine,\nThan they who have so many thousands slaine.\n\nWise Deborah that judged Israel,\nNor valiant Judeth cannot equall thee,\nUnto the first, God did his will reveale,\nAnd gave her powre to set his people free;\nYea Judeth had the powre likewise to queale\nProud Holifernes, that the just might see\nWhat small defence vaine pride, and greatnesse hath\nAgainst the weapons of Gods word and faith.\n\nBut thou farre greater warre do'st still maintaine,\nAgainst that many headed monster Sinne,\nWhose mortall sting hath many thousand slaine,\nAnd every day fresh combates doe begin;\nYet cannot all his venome lay one staine\nUpon thy Soule, thou do'st the conquest winne,\nThough all the world he daily doth devoure,\nYet over thee he never could get powre.\n\nFor that one worthy deed by Deb'rah done,\nThou hast performed many in thy time;\nFor that one Conquest that faire Judeth wonne,\nBy which shee did the steps of honour clime;\nThou hast the Conquest of all Conquests wonne,\nWhen to thy Conscience Hell can lay no crime:\nFor that one head that Judeth bare away,\nThou tak'st from Sinne a hundred heads a day.\n\nThough virtuous Hester fasted three dayes space,\nAnd spent her time in prayers all that while,\nThat by Gods powre shee might obtaine such grace,\nThat shee and hers might not become a spoyle\nTo wicked Hamon, in whose crabbed face\nWas seene the map of malice, envie, guile;\nHer glorious garments though shee put apart,\nSo to present a pure and single heart\nTo God, in sack-cloth, ashes, and with teares;\nYet must faire Hester needs give place to thee,\nWho hath continu'd dayes, weekes, months,\nand yeares,\nIn Gods true service, yet thy heart beeing free\nFrom doubt of death, or any other feares:\nFasting from sinne, thou pray'st thine eyes may see\nHim that hath full possession of thine heart,\nFrom whose sweet love thy Soule can never part.\n\nHis Love, not Feare, makes thee to fast and pray,\nNo kinsmans counsell needs thee to advise;\nThe sack-cloth thou do'st weare both night and day,\nIs worldly troubles, which thy rest denies;\nThe ashes are the Vanities that play\nOver thy head, and steale before thine eyes;\nWhich thou shak'st off when mourning time is past,\nThat royall roabes thou may'st put on at last.\n\nJoachims wife; that faire and constant Dame,\nWho rather chose a cruel death to die,\nThan yeeld to those two Elders voide of shame,\nWhen both at once her chastitie did trie,\nWhose Innocencie bare away the blame,\nUntill th'Almighty Lord had heard her crie;\nAnd rais'd the spirit of a Child to speake,\nMaking the powrefull judged of the weake.\n\nAlthough her virtue doe deserve to be\nWrit by that hand that never purchas'd blame;\nIn holy Writ, where all the world may see\nHer perfit life, and ever honoured name:\nYet was she not to be compar'd to thee,\nWhose many virtues doe increase thy fame:\nFor shee oppos'd against old doting Lust,\nWho with lifes danger she did feare to trust.\n\nBut your chaste breast, guarded with strength of mind,\nHates the imbracements of unchaste desires;\nYou loving God, live in your selfe confind\nFrom unpure Love, your purest thoughts retires,\nYour perfit sight could never be so blind,\nTo entertaine the old or yong desires\nOf idle Lovers; which the world presents,\nWhose base abuses worthy minds prevents.\n\nEven as the constant Lawrell, alwayes greene,\nNo parching heate of Summer can deface,\nNor pinching Winter ever yet was seene,\nWhose nipping frosts could wither, or disgrace:\nSo you (deere Ladie) still remaine as Queene,\nSubduing all affections that are base,\nUnalterable by the change of times,\nNot following, but lamenting others crimes.\n\nNo feare of Death, or dread of open shame,\nHinders your perfect heart to give consent;\nNor loathsome age, whom Time could never tame\nFrom ill designes, whereto their youth was bent;\nBut love of God, care to preserve your fame,\nAnd spend that pretious time that God hath sent,\nIn all good exercises of the minde,\nWhereto your noble nature is inclin'd.\n\nThat Ethyopian Queene did gaine great fame,\nWho from the Southerne world, did come to see\nGreat Salomon; the glory of whose name\nHad spread it selfe ore all the earth, to be\nSo great, that all the Princes thither came,\nTo be spectators of his royaltie:\nAnd this faire Queene of Sheba came from farre,\nTo reverence this new appearing starre.\n\nFrom th'utmost part of all the Earth shee came,\nTo heare the Wisdom of this worthy King;\nTo trie if Wonder did agree with Fame,\nAnd many faire rich presents did she bring:\nYea many strange hard questions did shee frame,\nAll which were answer'd by this famous King:\nNothing was hid that in her heart did rest,\nAnd all to proove this King so highly blest.\n\nHere Majestie with Majestie did meete,\nWisdome to Wisdome yeelded true content,\nOne Beauty did another Beauty greet,\nBounty to Bountie never could repent;\nHere all distaste is troden under feet,\nNo losse of time, where time was so well spent\nIn virtuous exercises of the minde,\nIn which this Queene did much contentment finde.\n\nSpirits affect where they doe sympathize,\nWisdom desires Wisdome to embrace,\nVirtue covets her like, and doth devize\nHow she her friends may entertaine with grace;\nBeauty sometime is pleas'd to feed her eyes,\nWith viewing Beautie in anothers face:\nBoth good and bad in this point doe agree,\nThat each desireth with his like to be.\n\nAnd this Desire did worke a strange effect,\nTo drawe a Queene forth of her native Land,\nNot yeelding to the nicenesse and respect\nOf woman-kind; shee past both sea and land,\nAll feare of dangers shee did quite neglect,\nOnely to see, to heare, and understand\nThat beauty, wisedome, majestie, and glorie,\nThat in her heart imprest his perfect storie.\n\nYet this faire map of majestie and might,\nWas but a figure of thy deerest Love,\nBorne t'expresse that true and heavenly light,\nThat doth all other joyes imperfect prove;\nIf this faire Earthly starre did shine so bright,\nWhat doth that glorious Sonne that is above?\n\nWho weares th'imperiall crowne of heaven\nand earth,\nAnd made all Christians blessed in his berth.\n\nIf that small sparke could yeeld so great a fire,\nAs to inflame the hearts of many Kings\nTo come to see, to heare, and to admire\nHis wisdome, tending but to worldly things;\nThen much more reason have we to desire\nThat heav'nly wisedome, which salvation brings;\nThe Sonne of righteousnesse, that gives true joyes,\nWhen all they fought for, were but Earthly toyes.\n\nNo travels ought th'affected soule to shunne,\nThat this faire heavenly Light desires to see:\nThis King of kings to whom we all should runne,\nTo view his Glory and his Majestie;\nHe without whom we all had beene undone,\nHe that from Sinne and Death hath set us free,\nAnd overcome Satan, the world, and sinne,\nThat by his merits we those joyes might winne.\n\nPrepar'd by him, whose everlasting throne\nIs plac'd in heaven, above the starrie skies,\nWhere he that sate, was like the Jasper stone,\nWho rightly knowes him shall be truely wise,\nA Rainebow round about his glorious throne;\nNay more, those winged beasts so full of eies,\nThat never cease to glorifie his Name,\nWho was, and will be, and is now the same.\n\nThis is that great almightie Lord that made\nBoth heaven and earth, and lives for evermore;\nBy him the worlds foundation first was laid:\nHe fram'd the things that never were before:\nThe Sea within his bounds by him is staid,\nHe judgeth all alike, both rich and poore:\nAll might, all majestie, all love, all lawe\nRemaines in him that keepes all worlds in awe.\n\nFrom his eternall throne the lightning came,\nThundrings and Voyces did from thence proceede;\nAnd all the creatures glorifi'd his name,\nIn heaven, in earth, and seas, they all agreed,\nWhen loe that spotlesse Lambe so voyd of blame,\nThat for us di'd, whose sinnes did make him bleed:\nThat true Physition that so many heales,\nOpened the Booke, and did undoe the Seales.\n\nHe onely worthy to undoe the Booke\nOf our charg'd soules, full of iniquitie,\nWhere with the eyes of mercy he doth looke\nUpon our weakenesse and infirmitie;\nThis is that corner stone that was forsooke,\nWho leaves it, trusts but to uncertaintie:\nThis is Gods Sonne, in whom he is well pleased,\nHis deere beloved, that his wrath appeased.\n\nHe that had powre to open all the Seales,\nAnd summon up our sinnes of blood and wrong,\nHe unto whom the righteous soules appeales,\nThat have bin martyrd, and doe thinke it long,\nTo whom in mercie he his will reveales,\nThat they should rest a little in their wrong,\nUntill their fellow servants should be killed,\nEven as they were, and that they were fulfilled.\n\nPure thoughted Lady, blessed be thy choyce\nOf this Almightie, everlasting King;\nIn thee his Saints and Angels doe rejoyce,.\n\nAnd to their Heav'nly Lord doe daily sing\nThy perfect praises in their lowdest voyce;\nAnd all their harpes and golden vials bring\nFull of sweet odours, even thy holy prayers\nUnto that spotlesse Lambe, that all repaires.\n\nOf whom that Heathen Queene obtain'd such grace,\nBy honouring but the shadow of his Love,\nThat great Judiciall day to have a place,\nCondemning those that doe unfaithfull prove;\nAmong the haplesse, happie is her case,\nThat her deere Saviour spake for her behove;\nAnd that her memorable Act should be\nWrit by the hand of true Eternitie.\n\nYet this rare Phoenix of that worne-out age,\nThis great majesticke Queene comes short of thee\nWho to an earthly Prince did then ingage\nHer hearts desires, her love, her libertie,\nActing her glorious part upon a Stage\nOf weaknesse, frailtie, and infirmity:\nGiving all honour to a Creature, due\nTo her Creator, whom shee never knew.\n\nBut loe, a greater thou hast sought and found\nThan Salomon in all his royaltie;\nAnd unto him thy faith most firmely bound\nTo serve and honour him continually;\nThat glorious God, whose terror doth confound\nAll sinfull workers of iniquitie:\nHim hast thou truely served all thy life,\nAnd for his love, liv'd with the world at strife.\n\nTo this great Lord, thou onely art affected,\nYet came he not in pompe or royaltie,\nBut in an humble habit, base, dejected;\nA King, a God, clad in mortalitie,\nHe hath thy love, thou art by him directed,\nHis perfect path was faire humilitie:\nWho being Monarke of heav'n, earth, and seas,\nIndur'd all wrongs, yet no man did displease.\n\nThen how much more art thou to be commended,\nThat seek'st thy love in lowly shepheards weed?\n\nA seeming Trades-mans sonne, of none attended,\nSave of a few in povertie and need;\nPoore Fishermen that on his love attended,\nHis love that makes so many thousands bleed:\nThus did he come, to trie our faiths the more,\nPossessing worlds, yet seeming extreame poore.\n\nThe Pilgrimes travels, and the Shepheards cares,\nHe tooke upon him to enlarge our soules,\nWhat pride hath lost, humilitie repaires,\nFor by his glorious death he us inroules\nIn deepe Characters, writ with blood and teares,\nUpon those blessed Everlasting scroules;\nHis hands, his feete, his body, and his face,\nWhence freely flow'd the rivers of his grace.\n\nSweet holy rivers, pure celestiall springs,\nProceeding from the fountaine of our life;\nSwift sugred currents that salvation brings,\nCleare christall streames, purging all sinne and strife,\nFaire floods, where souls do bathe their snow-white\nwings,\nBefore they flie to true eternall life:\nSweet Nectar and Ambrosia, food of Saints,\nWhich, whoso tasteth, never after faints.\n\nThis hony dropping dew of holy love,\nSweet milke, wherewith we weaklings are restored,\nWho drinkes thereof, a world can never move,\nAll earthly pleasures are of them abhorred;\nThis love made Martyrs many deaths to prove,\nTo taste his sweetnesse, whom they so adored:\nSweetnesse that makes our flesh a burthen to us,\nKnowing it serves but onely to undoe us.\n\nHis sweetnesse sweet'ned all the sowre of death,\nTo faithfull Stephen his appointed Saint;\nWho by the river stones did loose his breath,\nWhen paines nor terrors could not make him faint:\nSo was this blessed Martyr turn'd to earth,\nTo glorifie his soule by deaths attaint:\nThis holy Saint was humbled and cast downe,\nTo winne in heaven an everlasting crowne.\n\nWhose face repleat with Majestie and Sweetnesse,\nDid as an Angel unto them appeare,\nThat sate in Counsell hearing his discreetnesse,\nSeeing no change, or any signe of a feare;\nBut with a constant browe did there confesse\nChrists high deserts, which were to him so deare:\nYea when these Tyrants stormes did most oppresse,\nChrist did appeare to make his griefe the lesse.\n\nFor beeing filled with the holy Ghost,\nUp unto Heav'n he look'd with stedfast eies,\nWhere God appeared with his heavenly hoste\nIn glory to this Saint before he dies;\nAlthough he could no Earthly pleasures boast,\nAt Gods right hand sweet JESUS he espies;\nBids them behold Heavens open, he doth see\nThe Sonne of Man at Gods right hand to be.\n\nWhose sweetnesse sweet'ned that short sowre of Life,\nMaking all bitternesse delight his taste,\nYeelding sweet quietnesse in bitter strife,\nAnd most contentment when he di'd disgrac'd;\nHeaping up joyes where sorrows were most rife;\nSuch sweetnesse could not choose but be imbrac'd:\nThe food of Soules, the Spirits onely treasure,\nThe Paradise of our celestiall pleasure.\n\nThis Lambe of God, who di'd, and was alive,\nPresenting us the bread of life Eternall,\nHis bruised body powrefull to revive\nOur sinking soules, out of the pit infernall;\nFor by this blessed food he did contrive\nA worke of grace, by this his gift externall,\nWith heav'nly Manna, food of his elected,\nTo feed their soules, of whom he is respected.\n\nThis wheate of Heaven the blessed Angells bread,\nWherewith he feedes his deere adopted Heires;\nSweet foode of life that doth revive the dead,\nAnd from the living takes away all cares;\nTo taste this sweet Saint Laurence did not dread,\nThe broyling gridyorne cool'd with holy teares:\nYeelding his naked body to the fire,\nTo taste this sweetnesse, such was his desire.\n\nNay, what great sweetnesse did th'Apostles taste,\nCondemn'd by Counsell, when they did returne;\nRejoycing that for him they di'd disgrac'd,\nWhose sweetnes made their hearts and soules so burne\nWith holy zeale and love most pure and chaste;\nFor him they sought from whome they might not turne:\nWhose love made Andrew goe most joyfully,\nUnto the Crosse, on which he meant to die.\n\nThe Princes of th'Apostles were so filled\nWith the delicious sweetnes of his grace,\nThat willingly they yeelded to be killed,\nReceiving deaths that were most vile and base,\nFor his name sake, that all might be fulfilled.\n\nThey with great joy all torments did imbrace:\nThe ugli'st face that Death could ever yeeld,\nCould never feare these Champions from the field.\n\nThey still continued in their glorious fight,\nAgainst the enemies of flesh and blood;\nAnd in Gods law did set their whole delight,\nSuppressing evill, and erecting good:\nNot sparing Kings in what they did not right;\nTheir noble Actes they seal'd with deerest blood:\nOne chose the Gallowes, that unseemely death,\nThe other by the Sword did loose his breath.\n\nHis Head did pay the dearest rate of sin,\nYeelding it joyfully unto the Sword,\nTo be cut off as he had never bin,\nFor speaking truth according to Gods word,\nTelling king Herod of incestuous sin,\nThat hatefull crime of God and man abhorr'd:\nHis brothers wife, that prowd licentious Dame,\nCut off his Head to take away his shame.\n\nLoe Madame, heere you take a view of those,\nWhose worthy steps you doe desire to tread,\nDeckt in those colours which our Saviour chose;\nThe purest colours both of White and Red, Colours of\nTheir freshest beauties would I faine disclose, Confessors\nBy which our Saviour most was honoured:\nBut my weake Muse desireth now to rest,\nFolding up all their Beauties in your breast.\n\nWhose excellence hath rais'd my sprites to write,\nOf what my thoughts could hardly apprehend;\nYour rarest Virtues did my soule delight,\nGreat Ladie of my heart: I must commend\nYou that appeare so faire in all mens sight:\nOn your Deserts my Muses doe attend:\nYou are the Articke

pleasures\nWhilst the landskip round it measures,\nRusset lawns, and fallows gray,\nWhere the nibbling flocks do stray;\nMountains on whose barren breast\nThe labouring clouds do often rest;\nMeadows trim with daisies pied,\nShallow brooks, and rivers wide.\n\nTowers, and battlements it sees\nBosom'd high in tufted trees,\nWhere perhaps some beauty lies,\nThe cynosure of neighbouring eyes.\n\nHard by, a cottage chimney smokes,\nFrom betwixt two aged oaks,\nWhere Corydon and Thyrsis met,\nAre at their savoury dinner set\nOf herbs, and other country messes,\nWhich the neat-handed Phyllis dresses;\nAnd then in haste her bow'r she leaves,\nWith Thestylis to bind the sheaves;\nOr if the earlier season lead\nTo the tann'd haycock in the mead.\n\nSometimes with secure delight\nThe upland hamlets will invite,\nWhen the merry bells ring round,\nAnd the jocund rebecks sound\nTo many a youth, and many a maid,\nDancing in the chequer'd shade;\nAnd young and old come forth to play\nOn a sunshine holiday,\nTill the live-long daylight fail;\nThen to the spicy nut-brown ale,\nWith stories told of many a feat,\nHow Faery Mab the junkets eat,\nShe was pinch'd and pull'd she said,\nAnd he by friar's lanthorn led,\nTells how the drudging goblin sweat,\nTo earn his cream-bowl duly set,\nWhen in one night, ere glimpse of morn,\nHis shadowy flail hath thresh'd the corn\nThat ten day-labourers could not end;\nThen lies him down, the lubber fiend,\nAnd stretch'd out all the chimney's length,\nBasks at the fire his hairy strength;\nAnd crop-full out of doors he flings,\nEre the first cock his matin rings.\n\nThus done the tales, to bed they creep,\nBy whispering winds soon lull'd asleep.\n\nTower'd cities please us then,\nAnd the busy hum of men,\nWhere throngs of knights and barons bold,\nIn weeds of peace high triumphs hold,\nWith store of ladies, whose bright eyes\nRain influence, and judge the prize\nOf wit, or arms, while both contend\nTo win her grace, whom all commend.\n\nThere let Hymen oft appear\nIn saffron robe, with taper clear,\nAnd pomp, and feast, and revelry,\nWith mask, and antique pageantry;\nSuch sights as youthful poets dream\nOn summer eves by haunted stream.\n\nThen to the well-trod stage anon,\nIf Jonson's learned sock be on,\nOr sweetest Shakespeare, Fancy's child,\nWarble his native wood-notes wild.\n\nAnd ever against eating cares,\nLap me in soft Lydian airs,\nMarried to immortal verse,\nSuch as the meeting soul may pierce\nIn notes with many a winding bout\nOf linked sweetness long drawn out,\nWith wanton heed, and giddy cunning,\nThe melting voice through mazes running,\nUntwisting all the chains that tie\nThe hidden soul of harmony;\nThat Orpheus' self may heave his head\nFrom golden slumber on a bed\nOf heap'd Elysian flow'rs, and hear\nSuch strains as would have won the ear\nOf Pluto, to have quite set free\nHis half-regain'd Eurydice.\n\nThese delights if thou canst give,\nMirth, with thee I mean

little you bested,\nOr fill the fixed mind with all your toys;\nDwell in some idle brain,\nAnd fancies fond with gaudy shapes possess,\nAs thick and numberless\nAs the gay motes that people the sunbeams,\nOr likest hovering dreams,\nThe fickle pensioners of Morpheus' train.\n\nBut hail thou goddess, sage and holy,\nHail divinest Melancholy,\nWhose saintly visage is too bright\nTo hit the sense of human sight;\nAnd therefore to our weaker view,\nO'er-laid with black, staid Wisdom's hue;\nBlack, but such as in esteem,\nPrince Memnon's sister might beseem,\nOr that starr'd Ethiop queen that strove\nTo set her beauty's praise above\nThe sea nymphs, and their powers offended.\n\nYet thou art higher far descended,\nThee bright-hair'd Vesta long of yore,\nTo solitary Saturn bore;\nHis daughter she (in Saturn's reign,\nSuch mixture was not held a stain)\nOft in glimmering bow'rs and glades\nHe met her, and in secret shades\nOf woody Ida's inmost grove,\nWhile yet there was no fear of Jove.\n\nCome pensive nun, devout and pure,\nSober, stedfast, and demure,\nAll in a robe of darkest grain,\nFlowing with majestic train,\nAnd sable stole of cypress lawn,\nOver thy decent shoulders drawn.\n\nCome, but keep thy wonted state,\nWith ev'n step, and musing gait,\nAnd looks commercing with the skies,\nThy rapt soul sitting in thine eyes:\nThere held in holy passion still,\nForget thyself to marble, till\nWith a sad leaden downward cast,\nThou fix them on the earth as fast.\n\nAnd join with thee calm Peace, and Quiet,\nSpare Fast, that oft with gods doth diet,\nAnd hears the Muses in a ring,\nAye round about Jove's altar sing.\n\nAnd add to these retired Leisure,\nThat in trim gardens takes his pleasure;\nBut first, and chiefest, with thee bring\nHim that yon soars on golden wing,\nGuiding the fiery-wheeled throne,\nThe cherub Contemplation;\nAnd the mute Silence hist along,\n'Less Philomel will deign a song,\nIn her sweetest, saddest plight,\nSmoothing the rugged brow of night,\nWhile Cynthia checks her dragon yoke,\nGently o'er th' accustom'd oak.\n\nSweet bird that shunn'st the noise of folly,\nMost musical, most melancholy!\nThee, chauntress, oft the woods among,\nI woo to hear thy even-song;\nAnd missing thee, I walk unseen\nOn the dry smooth-shaven green,\nTo behold the wand'ring Moon,\nRiding near her highest noon,\nLike one that had been led astray\nThrough the heav'ns wide pathless way;\nAnd oft, as if her head she bow'd,\nStooping through a fleecy cloud.\n\nOft on a plat of rising ground,\nI hear the far-off curfew sound,\nOver some wide-water'd shore,\nSwinging slow with sullen roar;\nOr if the air will not permit,\nSome still removed place will fit,\nWhere glowing embers through the room\nTeach light to counterfeit a gloom,\nFar from all resort of mirth,\nSave the cricket on the hearth,\nOr the bellman's drowsy charm,\nTo bless the doors from nightly harm.\n\nOr let my lamp at midnight hour,\nBe seen in some high lonely tow'r,\nWhere I may oft out-watch the Bear,\nWith thrice great Hermes, or unsphere\nThe spirit of Plato, to unfold\nWhat worlds, or what vast regions hold\nThe immortal mind that hath forsook\nHer mansion in this fleshly nook:\nAnd of those d\u00e6mons that are found\nIn fire, air, flood, or under ground,\nWhose power hath a true consent\nWith planet, or with element.\n\nSometime let gorgeous Tragedy\nIn sceptr'd pall come sweeping by,\nPresenting Thebes', or Pelop's line,\nOr the tale of Troy divine,\nOr what (though rare) of later age,\nEnnobled hath the buskin'd stage.\n\nBut, O sad Virgin, that thy power\nMight raise Mus\u00e6us from his bower,\nOr bid the soul of Orpheus sing\nSuch notes as, warbled to the string,\nDrew iron tears down Pluto's cheek,\nAnd made Hell grant what love did seek.\n\nOr call up him that left half told\nThe story of Cambuscan bold,\nOf Camball, and of Algarsife,\nAnd who had Canace to wife,\nThat own'd the virtuous ring and glass,\nAnd of the wond'rous horse of brass,\nOn which the Tartar king did ride;\nAnd if aught else, great bards beside,\nIn sage and solemn tunes have sung,\nOf tourneys and of trophies hung,\nOf forests, and enchantments drear,\nWhere more is meant than meets the ear.\n\nThus, Night, oft see me in thy pale career,\nTill civil-suited Morn appear,\nNot trick'd and frounc'd as she was wont,\nWith the Attic boy to hunt,\nBut kerchief'd in a comely cloud,\nWhile rocking winds are piping loud,\nOr usher'd with a shower still,\nWhen the gust hath blown his fill,\nEnding on the rustling leaves,\nWith minute-drops from off the eaves.\n\nAnd when the Sun begins to fling\nHis flaring beams, me, goddess, bring\nTo arched walks of twilight groves,\nAnd shadows brown that Sylvan loves,\nOf pine, or monumental oak,\nWhere the rude axe with heaved stroke,\nWas never heard the nymphs to daunt,\nOr fright them from their hallow'd haunt.\n\nThere in close covert by some brook,\nWhere no profaner eye may look,\nHide me from Day's garish eye,\nWhile the bee with honied thigh,\nThat at her flow'ry work doth sing,\nAnd the waters murmuring\nWith such consort as they keep,\nEntice the dewy-feather'd sleep;\nAnd let some strange mysterious dream,\nWave at his wings, in airy stream\nOf lively portraiture display'd,\nSoftly on my eye-lids laid.\n\nAnd as I wake, sweet music breathe\nAbove, about, or underneath,\nSent by some spirit to mortals good,\nOr th' unseen Genius of the wood.\n\nBut let my due feet never fail\nTo walk the studious cloister's pale,\nAnd love the high embowed roof,\nWith antique pillars massy proof,\nAnd storied windows richly dight,\nCasting a dim religious light.\n\nThere let the pealing organ blow,\nTo the full-voic'd quire below,\nIn service high, and anthems clear,\nAs may with sweetness, through mine ear,\nDissolve me into ecstasies,\nAnd bring all Heav'n before mine eyes.\n\nAnd may at last my weary age\nFind out the peaceful hermitage,\nThe hairy gown and mossy cell,\nWhere I may sit and rightly spell\nOf every star that Heav'n doth shew,\nAnd every herb that sips the dew;\nTill old experience do attain\nTo something like prophetic strain.\n\nThese pleasures, Melancholy, give,\nAnd I with thee will choose to live.", "period": "Caroline", "literary_movement": "Metaphysical Poets", "register": "Meditative",

and, but for such,\nI would not soil these pure ambrosial weeds\nWith the rank vapours of this sin-worn mould.\n\nBut to my task.\n\nNeptune, besides the sway\nOf every salt flood and each ebbing stream,\nTook in by lot, \u2018twixt high and nether Jove,\nImperial rule of all the sea-girt isles\nThat, like to rich and various gems, inlay\nThe unadorned bosom of the deep;\nWhich he, to grace his tributary gods,\nBy course commits to several government,\nAnd gives them leave to wear their sapphire crowns\nAnd wield their little tridents.\n\nBut this Isle,\nThe greatest and the best of all the main,\nHe quarters to his blue-haired deities;\nAnd all this tract that fronts the falling sun\nA noble Peer of mickle trust and power\nHas in his charge, with tempered awe to guide\nAn old and haughty nation, proud in arms:\nWhere his fair offspring, nursed in princely lore,\nAre coming to attend their father\u2019s state,\nAnd new-intrusted sceptre.\n\nBut their way\nLies through the perplexed paths of this drear wood,\nThe nodding horror of whose shady brows\nThreats the forlorn and wandering passenger;\nAnd here their tender age might suffer peril,\nBut that, by quick command from sovran Jove,\nI was despatched for their defence and guard:\nAnd listen why; for I will tell you now\nWhat never yet was heard in tale or song,\nFrom old or modern bard, in hall or bower.\n\nBacchus, that first from out the purple grape\nCrushed the sweet poison of misused wine,\nAfter the Tuscan mariners transformed,\nCoasting the Tyrrhene shore, as the winds listed,\nOn Circe\u2019s island fell.\n\n(Who knows not Circe,\nThe daughter of the Sun, whose charmed cup\nWhoever tasted lost his upright shape,\nAnd downward fell into a grovelling swine?\n\nThis Nymph, that gazed upon his clustering locks,\nWith ivy berries wreathed, and his blithe youth,\nHad by him, ere he parted thence, a son\nMuch like his father, but his mother more,\nWhom therefore she brought up, and Comus named:\nWho, ripe and frolic of his full-grown age,\nRoving the Celtic and Iberian fields,\nAt last betakes him to this ominous wood,\nAnd, in thick shelter of black shades imbowered,\nExcels his mother at her mighty art;\nOffering to every weary traveller\nHis orient liquor in a crystal glass,\nTo quench the drouth of Phoebus; which as they taste\n(For most do taste through fond intemperate thirst),\nSoon as the potion works, their human count\u2019nance,\nThe express resemblance of the gods, is changed\nInto some brutish form of wolf or bear,\nOr ounce or tiger, hog, or bearded goat,\nAll other parts remaining as they were.\n\nAnd they, so perfect is their misery,\nNot once perceive their foul disfigurement,\nBut boast themselves more comely than before,\nAnd all their friends and native home forget,\nTo roll with pleasure in a sensual sty.\n\nTherefore, when any favoured of high Jove\nChances to pass through this adventurous glade,\nSwift as the sparkle of a glancing star\nI shoot from heaven, to give him safe convoy,\nAs now I do.\n\nBut first I must put off\nThese my sky-robes, spun out of Iris\u2019 woof,\nAnd take the weeds and likeness of a swain\nThat to the service of this house belongs,\nWho, with his soft pipe and smooth-dittied song,\nWell knows to still the wild winds when they roar,\nAnd hush the waving woods; nor of less faith\nAnd in this office of his mountain watch\nLikeliest, and nearest to the present aid\nOf this occasion.\n\nBut I hear the tread\nOf hateful steps; I must be viewless now.\n\nCOMUS enters, with a charming-rod in one hand, his glass in the\nother: with him a rout of monsters, headed like sundry sorts of\nwild\nbeasts, but otherwise like men and women, their apparel\nglistering.\n\nThey come in making a riotous and unruly noise, with torches in\ntheir hands.\n\nCOMUS.\n\nThe star that bids the shepherd fold\nNow the top of heaven doth hold;\nAnd the gilded car of day\nHis glowing axle doth allay\nIn the steep Atlantic stream;\nAnd the slope sun his upward beam\nShoots against the dusky pole,\nPacing toward the other goal\nOf his chamber in the east.\n\nMeanwhile, welcome joy and feast,\nMidnight shout and revelry,\nTipsy dance and jollity.\n\nBraid your locks with rosy twine,\nDropping odours, dropping wine.\n\nRigour now is gone to bed;\nAnd Advice with scrupulous head,\nStrict Age, and sour Severity,\nWith their grave saws, in slumber lie.\n\nWe, that are of purer fire,\nImitate the starry quire,\nWho, in their nightly watchful spheres,\nLead in swift round the months and years.\n\nThe sounds and seas, with all their finny drove,\nNow to the moon in wavering morrice move;\nAnd on the tawny sands and shelves\nTrip the pert fairies and the dapper elves.\n\nBy dimpled brook and fountain-brim,\nThe wood-nymphs, decked with daisies trim,\nTheir merry wakes and pastimes keep:\nWhat hath night to do with sleep?\n\nNight hath better sweets to prove;\nVenus now wakes, and wakens Love.\n\nCome, let us our rights begin;\n\u2018T is only daylight that makes sin,\nWhich these dun shades will ne\u2019er report.\n\nHail, goddess of nocturnal sport,\nDark-veiled Cotytto, to whom the secret flame\nOf midnight torches burns! mysterious dame,\nThat ne\u2019er art called but when the dragon womb\nOf Stygian darkness spets her thickest gloom,\nAnd makes one blot of all the air!\nStay thy cloudy ebon chair,\nWherein thou ridest with Hecat\u2019, and befriend\nUs thy vowed priests, till utmost end\nOf all thy dues be done, and none left out,\nEre the blabbing eastern scout,\nThe nice Morn on the Indian steep,\nFrom her cabined loop-hole peep,\nAnd to the tell-tale Sun descry\nOur concealed solemnity.\n\nCome, knit hands, and beat the ground\nIn a light fantastic round.\n\nThe Measure.\n\nBreak off, break off!

while Heaven lends us grace,\nLet us fly this cursed place,\nLest the sorcerer us entice\nWith some other new device.\n\nNot a waste or needless sound\nTill we come to holier ground.\n\nI shall be your faithful guide\nThrough this gloomy covert wide;\nAnd not many furlongs thence\nIs your Father\u2019s residence,\nWhere this night are met in state\nMany a friend to gratulate\nHis wished presence, and beside\nAll the swains that there abide\nWith jigs and rural dance resort.\n\nWe shall catch them at their sport,\nAnd our sudden coming there\nWill double all their mirth and cheer.\n\nCome, let us haste;

morn,\nWherein the Son of Heav'n's eternal King,\nOf wedded Maid, and Virgin Mother born,\nOur great redemption from above did bring;\nFor so the holy sages once did sing,\nThat he our deadly forfeit should release,\nAnd with his Father work us a perpetual peace.\n\nThat glorious Form, that Light unsufferable,\nAnd that far-beaming blaze of Majesty,\nWherewith he wont at Heav'n's high council-table,\nTo sit the midst of Trinal Unity,\nHe laid aside, and here with us to be,\nForsook the courts of everlasting day,\nAnd chose with us a darksome house of mortal clay.\n\nSay Heav'nly Muse, shall not thy sacred vein\nAfford a present to the Infant God?\n\nHast thou no verse, no hymn, or solemn strain,\nTo welcome him to this his new abode,\nNow while the heav'n, by the Sun's team untrod,\nHath took no print of the approaching light,\nAnd all the spangled host keep watch in squadrons bright?\n\nSee how from far upon the eastern road\nThe star-led wizards haste with odours sweet:\nO run, prevent them with thy humble ode,\nAnd lay it lowly at his blessed feet;\nHave thou the honour first thy Lord to greet,\nAnd join thy voice unto the angel quire,\nFrom out his secret altar touch'd with hallow'd fire.\n\nIt was the winter wild,\nWhile the Heav'n-born child,\nAll meanly wrapt in the rude manger lies;\nNature in awe to him\nHad doff'd her gaudy trim,\nWith her great Master so to sympathize:\nIt was no season then for her\nTo wanton with the Sun, her lusty paramour.\n\nOnly with speeches fair\nShe woos the gentle air\nTo hide her guilty front with innocent snow,\nAnd on her naked shame,\nPollute with sinful blame,\nThe saintly veil of maiden white to throw,\nConfounded, that her Maker's eyes\nShould look so near upon her foul deformities.\n\nBut he, her fears to cease,\nSent down the meek-ey'd Peace:\nShe, crown'd with olive green, came softly sliding\nDown through the turning sphere,\nHis ready harbinger,\nWith turtle wing the amorous clouds dividing;\nAnd waving wide her myrtle wand,\nShe strikes a universal peace through sea and land.\n\nNo war or battle's sound\nWas heard the world around;\nThe idle spear and shield were high uphung;\nThe hooked chariot stood\nUnstain'd with hostile blood;\nThe trumpet spake not to the armed throng;\nAnd kings sate still with awful eye,\nAs if they surely knew their sovran Lord was by.\n\nBut peaceful was the night\nWherein the Prince of Light\nHis reign of peace upon the earth began:\nThe winds with wonder whist,\nSmoothly the waters kist,\nWhispering new joys to the mild Ocean,\nWho now hath quite forgot to rave,\nWhile birds of calm sit brooding on the charmed wave.\n\nThe Stars with deep amaze\nStand fix'd in steadfast gaze,\nBending one way their precious influence;\nAnd will not take their flight,\nFor all the morning light,\nOr Lucifer that often warn'd them thence,\nBut in their glimmering orbs did glow,\nUntil their Lord himself bespake, and bid them go.\n\nAnd though the shady gloom\nHad given day her room,\nThe Sun himself withheld his wonted speed,\nAnd hid his head for shame,\nAs his inferior flame\nThe new-enlighten'd world no more should need:\nHe saw a greater Sun appear\nThan his bright throne or burning axle-tree could bear.\n\nThe shepherds on the lawn,\nOr ere the point of dawn,\nSate simply chatting in a rustic row;\nFull little thought they than\nThat the mighty Pan\nWas kindly come to live with them below:\nPerhaps their loves, or else their sheep,\nWas all that did their silly thoughts so busy keep;\n\nWhen such music sweet\nTheir hearts and ears did greet,\nAs never was by mortal finger strook,\nDivinely warbled voice\nAnswering the stringed noise,\nAs all their souls in blissful rapture took:\nThe air such pleasure loth to lose,\nWith thousand echoes still prolongs each heav'nly close.\n\nNature, that heard such sound\nBeneath the hollow round\nOf Cynthia's seat, the Airy region thrilling,\nNow was almost won\nTo think her part was done,\nAnd that her reign had here its last fulfilling:\nShe knew such harmony alone\nCould hold all heav'n and earth in happier union.\n\nAt last surrounds their sight\nA globe of circular light,\nThat with long beams the shame-fac'd Night array'd;\nThe helmed Cherubim\nAnd sworded Seraphim\nAre seen in glittering ranks with wings display'd,\nHarping in loud and solemn quire,\nWith unexpressive notes to Heav'n's new-born Heir.\n\nSuch music (as 'tis said)\nBefore was never made,\nBut when of old the sons of morning sung,\nWhile the Creator great\nHis constellations set,\nAnd the well-balanc'd world on hinges hung,\nAnd cast the dark foundations deep,\nAnd bid the welt'ring waves their oozy channel keep.\n\nRing out ye crystal spheres!\nOnce bless our human ears\n(If ye have power to touch our senses so)\nAnd let your silver chime\nMove in melodious time,\nAnd let the bass of Heav'n's deep organ blow;\nAnd with your ninefold harmony\nMake up full consort to th'angelic symphony.\n\nFor if such holy song\nEnwrap our fancy long,\nTime will run back and fetch the age of gold,\nAnd speckl'd Vanity\nWill sicken soon and die,\nAnd leprous Sin will melt from earthly mould;\nAnd Hell itself will pass away,\nAnd leave her dolorous mansions to the peering Day.\n\nYea, Truth and Justice then\nWill down return to men,\nOrb'd in a rainbow; and, like glories wearing,\nMercy will sit between,\nThron'd in celestial sheen,\nWith radiant feet the tissu'd clouds down steering;\nAnd Heav'n, as at some festival,\nWill open wide the gates of her high palace hall.\n\nBut wisest Fate says no:\nThis must not yet be so;\nThe Babe lies yet in smiling infancy,\nThat on the bitter cross\nMust redeem our loss,\nSo both himself and us to glorify:\nYet first to those ychain'd in sleep,\nThe wakeful trump of doom must thunder through the deep,\n\nWith such a horrid clang\nAs on Mount Sinai rang\nWhile the red fire and smould'ring clouds outbrake:\nThe aged Earth, aghast\nWith terror of that blast,\nShall from the surface to the centre shake,\nWhen at the world's last session,\nThe dreadful Judge in middle air shall spread his throne.\n\nAnd then at last our bliss\nFull and perfect is,\nBut now begins; for from this happy day\nTh'old Dragon under ground,\nIn straiter limits bound,\nNot half so far casts his usurped sway,\nAnd, wrath to see his kingdom fail,\nSwinges the scaly horror of his folded tail.\n\nThe Oracles are dumb;\nNo voice or hideous hum\nRuns through the arched roof in words deceiving.\n\nApollo from his shrine\nCan no more divine,\nWith hollow shriek the steep of Delphos leaving.\n\nNo nightly trance or breathed spell\nInspires the pale-ey'd priest from the prophetic cell.\n\nThe lonely mountains o'er,\nAnd the resounding shore,\nA voice of weeping heard and loud lament;\nFrom haunted spring, and dale\nEdg'd with poplar pale,\nThe parting Genius is with sighing sent;\nWith flow'r-inwoven tresses torn\nThe Nymphs in twilight shade of tangled thickets mourn.\n\nIn consecrated earth,\nAnd on the holy hearth,\nThe Lars and Lemures moan with midnight plaint;\nIn urns and altars round,\nA drear and dying sound\nAffrights the flamens at their service quaint;\nAnd the chill marble seems to sweat,\nWhile each peculiar power forgoes his wonted seat.\n\nPeor and Ba{:a}lim\nForsake their temples dim,\nWith that twice-batter'd god of Palestine;\nAnd mooned Ashtaroth,\nHeav'n's queen and mother both,\nNow sits not girt with tapers' holy shine;\nThe Libyc Hammon shrinks his horn;\nIn vain the Tyrian maids their wounded Thammuz mourn.\n\nAnd sullen Moloch, fled,\nHath left in shadows dread\nHis burning idol all of blackest hue:\nIn vain with cymbals' ring\nThey call the grisly king,\nIn dismal dance about the furnace blue.\n\nThe brutish gods of Nile as fast,\nIsis and Orus, and the dog Anubis, haste.\n\nNor is Osiris seen\nIn Memphian grove or green,\nTrampling the unshower'd grass with lowings loud;\nNor can he be at rest\nWithin his sacred chest,\nNaught but profoundest Hell can be his shroud:\nIn vain with timbrel'd anthems dark\nThe sable-stoled sorcerers bear his worshipp'd ark.\n\nHe feels from Juda's land\nThe dreaded Infant's hand,\nThe rays of Bethlehem blind his dusky eyn;\nNor all the gods beside\nLonger dare abide,\nNot Typhon huge ending in snaky twine:\nOur Babe, to show his Godhead true,\nCan in his swaddling bands control the damned crew.\n\nSo when the Sun in bed,\nCurtain'd with cloudy red,\nPillows his chin upon an orient wave,\nThe flocking shadows pale\nTroop to th'infernal jail,\nEach fetter'd ghost slips to his several grave,\nAnd the yellow-skirted fays\nFly after the night-steeds, leaving their moon-lov'd maze.\n\nBut see, the Virgin blest\nHath laid her Babe to rest:\nTime is our tedious song should here have ending.\n\nHeav'n's youngest-teemed star,\nHath fix'd her polish'd car,\nHer sleeping Lord with handmaid lamp attending;\nAnd all about the courtly stable,\nBright-harness'd Angels sit in order serviceable.", "period": "Caroline", "literary_movement": "Metaphysical Poets",

and sadly are we sure\nStill to be sick, till Heav'n reveal the cure:\nIf then Heaven's will must needs be understood,\n(Which must, if we want cure, and Heaven be good)\nLet all records of will reveal'd be shown;\nWith Scripture, all in equal balance thrown,\nAnd our one sacred Book will be that one.\n\nProof needs not here, for whether we compare\nThat impious, idle, superstitious ware\nOf rites, lustrations, offerings, (which before,\nIn various ages, various countries bore)\nWith Christian faith and virtues, we shall find\nNone answ'ring the great ends of human kind,\nBut this one rule of life: that shows us best\nHow God may be appeas'd, and mortals blest.\n\nWhether from length of time its worth we draw,\nThe world is scarce more ancient than the law:\nHeav'n's early care prescrib'd for every age;\nFirst, in the soul, and after, in the page.\n\nOr, whether more abstractedly we look,\nOr on the writers, or the written Book,\nWhence, but from Heav'n, could men unskill'd in arts,\nIn several ages born, in several parts,\nWeave such agreeing truths?\n\nor how, or why\nShould all conspire to cheat us with a lie?\n\nUnask'd their pains, ungrateful their advice,\nStarving their gain, and martyrdom their price.\n\nIf on the Book itself we cast our view,\nConcurrent heathens prove the story true:\nThe doctrine, miracles; which must convince,\nFor Heav'n in them appeals to human sense:\nAnd though they prove not, they confirm the cause,\nWhen what is taught agrees with Nature's laws.\n\nThen for the style; majestic and divine,\nIt speaks no less than God in every line:\nCommanding words; whose force is still the same\nAs the first fiat that produc'd our frame.\n\nAll faiths beside, or did by arms ascend;\nOr sense indulg'd has made mankind their friend:\nThis only doctrine does our lusts oppose:\nUnfed by Nature's soil, in which it grows;\nCross to our interests, curbing sense, and sin;\nOppress'd without, and undermin'd within,\nIt thrives through pain; its own tormentors tires;\nAnd with a stubborn patience still aspires.\n\nTo what can reason such effects assign,\nTranscending Nature, but to laws divine:\nWhich in that sacred volume are contain'd;\nSufficient, clear, and for that use ordain'd.\n\nBut stay: the Deist here will urge anew,\nNo supernatural worship can be true:\nBecause a general law is that alone\nWhich must to all, and everywhere be known:\nA style so large as not this Book can claim\nNor aught that bears reveal'd religion's name.\n\n'Tis said the sound of a Messiah's Birth\nIs gone through all the habitable earth:\nBut still that text must be confin'd alone\nTo what was then inhabited, and known:\nAnd what Provision could from thence accrue\nTo Indian souls, and worlds discover'd new?\n\nIn other parts it helps, that ages past,\nThe Scriptures there were known, and were embrac'd,\nTill sin spread once again the shades of night:\nWhat's that to these who never saw the light?\n\nOf all objections this indeed is chief\nTo startle reason, stagger frail belief:\nWe grant, 'tis true, that Heav'n from human sense\nHas hid the secret paths of Providence:\nBut boundless wisdom, boundless mercy, may\nFind ev'n for those bewilder'd souls, a way:\nIf from his nature foes may pity claim,\nMuch more may strangers who ne'er heard his name.\n\nAnd though no name be for salvation known,\nBut that of his eternal Son's alone;\nWho knows how far transcending goodness can\nExtend the merits of that Son to man?\n\nWho knows what reasons may his mercy lead;\nOr ignorance invincible may plead?\n\nNot only charity bids hope the best,\nBut more the great Apostle has expressed.\n\nThat, if the Gentiles (whom no law inspir'd,)\nBy nature did what was by law requir'd;\nThey, who the written rule had never known,\nWere to themselves both rule and law alone:\nTo nature's plain indictment they shall plead;\nAnd, by their conscience, be condemn'd or freed.\n\nMost righteous doom! because a rule reveal'd\nIs none to those, from whom it was conceal'd.\n\nThen those who follow'd reason's dictates right;\nLiv'd up, and lifted high their natural light;\nWith Socrates may see their Maker's Face,\nWhile thousand rubric-martyrs want a place.\n\nNor does it baulk my charity, to find\nTh'Egyptian Bishop of another mind:\nFor, though his Creed eternal truth contains,\n'Tis hard for man to doom to endless pains\nAll who believ'd not all, his zeal requir'd,\nUnless he first could prove he was inspir'd.\n\nThen let us either think he meant to say\nThis faith, where publish'd, was the only way;\nOr else conclude that, Arius to confute,\nThe good old man, too eager in dispute,\nFlew high;

the fair Lodona nam'd;\n(Lodona's fate, in long oblivion cast,\nThe Muse shall sing, and what she sings shall last.\n\nScarce could the Goddess from her nymph be known,\nBut by the crescent and the golden zone.\n\nShe scorn'd the praise of beauty, and the care,\nA belt her waist, a fillet binds her hair,\nA painted quiver on her shoulder sounds,\nAnd with her dart the flying deer she wounds.\n\nIt chanc'd, as eager of the chace, the maid\nBeyond the forest's verdant limits stray'd,\nPan saw and lov'd, and burning with desire\nPursu'd her flight, her flight increas'd his fire.\n\nNot half so swift the trembling doves can fly,\nWhen the fierce eagle cleaves the liquid sky;\nNot half so swiftly the fierce eagle moves,\nWhen thro' the clouds he drives the trembling doves;\nAs from the God she flew with furious pace,\nOr as the God, more furious, urg'd the chace.\n\nNow fainting, sinking, pale, the nymph appears;\nNow close behind, his sounding steps she hears;\nAnd now his shadow reach'd her as she run,\nHis shadow lengthen'd by the setting sun;\nAnd now his shorter breath, with sultry air,\nPants on her neck, and fans her parting hair.\n\nIn vain on father Thames she call'd for aid,\nNor could Diana help her injur'd maid.\n\nFaint, breathless, thus she pray'd, nor pray'd in vain;\n\"Ah Cynthia! ah tho' banish'd from thy train,\n\"Let me, O let me, to the shades repair,\n\"My native shades there weep, and murmur there.\n\nShe said, and melting as in tears she lay,\nIn a soft, silver stream dissolv'd away.\n\nThe silver stream her virgin coldness keeps,\nFor ever murmurs, and for ever weeps;\nStill bears the name the hapless virgin bore,\nAnd bathes the forest where she rang'd before.\n\nIn her chaste current oft' the Goddess laves,\nAnd with celestial tears augments the waves.\n\nOft' in her glass the musing shepherd spies\nThe headlong mountains and the downward skies,\nThe watry landskip of the pendant woods,\nAnd absent trees that tremble in the floods;\nIn the clear azure gleam the flocks are seen,\nAnd floating forests paint the waves with green.\n\nThro' the fair scene rowl slow the ling'ring streams,\nThen foaming pour along, and rush into the Thames.\n\nThou too, great father of the British floods!\nWith joyful pride survey'st our lofty woods;\nWhere tow'ring oaks their spreading honours rear,\nAnd future navies on thy shores appear.\n\nNot Neptune's self from all his streams receives\nA wealthier tribute, than to thine he gives.\n\nNo seas so rich, so gay no banks appear,\nNo lake so gentle, and no spring so clear.\n\nNot fabled Po more swells the poet's lays,\nWhile thro' the skies his shining current strays,\nThan thine, which visits Windsor's fam'd abodes,\nTo grace the mansion of our earthly Gods:\nNor all his stars a brighter lustre show,\nThan the fair nymphs that grace thy side below:\nHere Jove himself, subdu'd by beauty still,\nMight change Olympus for a nobler hill.\n\nHappy the man whom this bright Court approves,\nHis Sov'reign favours, and his Country loves:\nHappy next him, who to these shades retires,\nWhom Nature charms, and whom the Muse inspires;\nWhom humbler joys of home-felt quiet please,\nSuccessive study, exercise, and ease.\n\nHe gathers health from herbs the forest yields,\nAnd of their fragrant physic spoils the fields:\nWith chymic art exalts the min'ral pow'rs,\nAnd draws the aromatic souls of flow'rs:\nNow marks the course of rolling orbs on high;\nO'er figur'd worlds now travels with his eye:\nOf ancient writ unlocks the learned store,\nConsults the dead, and lives past ages o'er:\nOr wand'ring thoughtful in the silent wood,\nAttends the duties of the wise and good,\nT'observe a mean, be to himself a friend,\nTo follow nature, and regard his end;\nOr looks on heav'n with more than mortal eyes,\nBids his free soul expatiate in the skies,\nAmid her kindred stars familiar roam,\nSurvey the region, and confess her home!\nSuch was the life great Scipio once admir'd,\nThus Atticus, and Trumbal thus retir'd.\n\nYe sacred Nine! that all my soul possess,\nWhose raptures fire me, and whose visions bless,\nBear me, oh bear me to sequester'd scenes,\nThe bow'ry mazes, and surrounding greens;\nTo Thames's banks which fragrant breezes fill,\nOr where ye Muses sport on Cooper's hill.\n\n(On Cooper's hill eternal wreaths shall grow,\nWhile lasts the mountain, or while Thames shall flow)\nI seem thro' consecrated walks to rove,\nI hear soft music die along the grove;\nLed by the sound, I roam from shade to shade,\nBy god-like Poets venerable made:\nHere his first lays majestic Denham sung;\nThere the last numbers flow'd from Cowley's tongue.\n\nO early lost! what tears the river shed,\nWhen the sad pomp along his banks was led?\n\nHis drooping swans on ev'ry note expire,\nAnd on his willows hung each Muse's lyre.\n\nSince fate relentless stop'd their heav'nly voice,\nNo more the forests ring, or groves rejoice;\nWho now shall charm the shades, where Cowley strung\nHis living harp, and lofty Denham sung?\n\nBut hark! the groves rejoice, the forest rings!\nAre these reviv'd?\n\nor is it Granville sings?\n\n'Tis yours, my Lord, to bless our soft retreats,\nAnd call the Muses to their ancient seats;\nTo paint anew the flow'ry sylvan scenes,\nTo crown the forests with immortal greens,\nMake Windsor-hills in lofty numbers rise,\nAnd lift her turrets nearer to the skies;\nTo sing those honours you deserve to wear,\nAnd add new lustre to her silver star.\n\nHere noble Surrey felt the sacred rage,\nSurrey, the Granville of a former age:\nMatchless his pen, victorious was his lance,\nBold in the lists, and graceful in the dance:\nIn the same shades the Cupids tun'd his lyre,\nTo the same notes, of love, and soft desire:\nFair Geraldine, bright object of his vow,\nThen fill'd the groves, as heav'nly Myra now.\n\nOh would'st thou sing what Heroes Windsor bore,\nWhat Kings first breath'd upon her winding shore,\nOr raise old warriours, whose ador'd remains\nIn weeping vaults her hallow'd earth contains!\nWith Edward's acts adorn the shining page,\nStretch his long triumphs down thro' ev'ry age,\nDraw Monarchs chain'd, and Cressi's glorious field,\nThe lillies blazing on the regal shield:\nThen, from her roofs when Verrio's colours fall,\nAnd leave inanimate the naked wall,\nStill in thy song should vanquish'd France appear,\nAnd bleed for ever under Britain's spear.\n\nLet softer strains ill-fated Henry mourn,\nAnd palms eternal flourish round his urn,\nHere o'er the martyr-King the marble weeps,\nAnd fast beside him, once-fear'd Edward sleeps:\nWhom not th' extended Albion could contain,\nFrom old Belerium to the northern main,\nThe grave unites; where ev'n the Great find rest,\nAnd blended lie th' oppressor and th' opprest!\nMake sacred Charles's tomb for ever known,\n(Obscure the place, and un-inscrib'd the stone)\nOh fact accurst! what tears has Albion shed,\nHeav'ns, what new wounds! and how her old have bled?\n\nShe saw her sons with purple deaths expire,\nHer sacred domes involv'd in rolling fire,\nA dreadful series of intestine wars,\nInglorious triumphs, and dishonest scars.\n\nAt length great Anna said \"Let Discord cease!\"\nShe said, the World obey'd, and all was Peace!\nIn that blest moment, from his oozy bed\nOld father Thames advanc'd his rev'rend head.\n\nHis tresses drop'd with dews, and o'er the stream\nHis shining horns diffus'd a golden gleam:\nGrav'd on his urn, appear'd the Moon that guides\nHis swelling waters, and alternate tydes;\nThe figur'd streams in waves of silver roll'd,\nAnd on their banks Augusta rose in gold.\n\nAround his throne the sea-born brothers stood,\nWho swell with tributary urns his flood:\nFirst the fam'd authors of his ancient name,\nThe winding Isis and the fruitful Tame:\nThe Kennet swift, for silver eels renown'd;\nThe Loddon slow, with verdant alders crown'd;\nCole, whose clear streams his flow'ry islands lave;\nAnd chalky Wey, that rolls a milky wave:\nThe blue, transparent Vandalis appears;\nThe gulphy Lee his sedgy tresses rears;\nAnd sullen Mole, that hides his diving flood;\nAnd silent Darent, stain'd with Danish blood.\n\nHigh in the midst, upon his urn reclin'd,\n(His sea-green mantle waving with the wind)\nThe God appear'd: he turn'd his azure eyes\nWhere Windsor-domes and pompous turrets rise;\nThen bow'd and spoke; the winds forget to roar,\nAnd the hush'd waves glide softly to the shore.\n\nHail, sacred Peace!

out-spread\nTo hatch a new Saturnian age of lead.\n\nClose to those walls where Folly holds her throne,\nAnd laughs to think Monroe would take her down,\nWhere o\u2019er the gates, by his famed by father\u2019s hand\nGreat Cibber\u2019s brazen, brainless brothers stand;\nOne cell there is, concealed from vulgar eye,\nThe cave of poverty and poetry.\n\nKeen, hollow winds howl through the bleak recess,\nEmblem of music caused by emptiness.\n\nHence bards, like Proteus long in vain tied down,\nEscape in monsters, and amaze the town.\n\nHence miscellanies spring, the weekly boast\nOf

grace,\nAnd new Year odes, and all the Grub Street race.\n\nIn clouded majesty here Dulness shone;\nFour guardian virtues, round, support her throne:\nFierce champion Fortitude, that knows no

goal.\n\nPoetic justice, with her lifted scale,\nWhere, in nice balance, truth with gold she weighs,\nAnd solid pudding against empty praise.\n\nHere she beholds the chaos dark and deep,\nWhere

first is taught to cry.\n\nMaggots half-formed in rhyme exactly meet,\nAnd learn to crawl upon poetic feet.\n\nHere one poor word an hundred clenches makes,\nAnd ductile dullness new meanders

embrace;\nHow farce and epic get a jumbled race;\nHow time himself stands still at her command,\nRealms shift their place, and ocean turns to land.\n\nHere gay description Egypt glads with showers,\nOr gives to Zembla fruits, to Barca flowers;\nGlittering with ice here hoary hills are seen,\nThere painted valleys of eternal green,\nIn cold December fragrant chaplets blow,\nAnd heavy

in Settle\u2019s numbers, one day more.\n\nNow mayors and shrieves all hushed and satiate lay,\nYet eat, in dreams, the custard of the day;\nWhile pensive poets painful vigils keep,\nSleepless themselves, to give their readers sleep.\n\nMuch to the mindful Queen the feast recalls\nWhat city swans once sung within the walls;\nMuch she revolves their arts, their ancient praise,\nAnd sure succession down from Heywood\u2019s days.\n\nShe saw, with joy, the line immortal run,\nEach sire impressed and glaring in his son:\nSo watchful Bruin forms, with plastic care,\nEach growing lump, and brings it to a bear.\n\nShe saw old Prynne in restless Daniel shine,\nAnd Eusden eke out Blackmore\u2019s endless line;\nShe saw slow Philips creep like Tate\u2019s poor page,\nAnd all the mighty mad in Dennis rage.\n\nIn each she marks her image full expressed,\nBut chief in BAY\u2019S monster-breeding breast;\nBays, formed by nature stage and town to bless,\nAnd act, and be, a coxcomb with success.\n\nDulness with transport eyes the lively dunce,\nRemembering she herself was pertness once.\n\nNow (shame to fortune!) an ill run at play\nBlanked his bold visage, and a thin third day:\nSwearing and supperless the hero sate,\nBlasphemed his gods, the dice, and damned his fate.\n\nThen gnawed his pen, then dashed it on the ground,\nSinking from thought to thought, a vast profound!\nPlunged for his sense, but found no bottom there,\nYet wrote and floundered on, in mere despair.\n\nRound him much embryo, much abortion lay,\nMuch future ode, and abdicated play;\nNonsense precipitate, like running lead,\nThat slipped through cracks and zigzags of the head;\nAll that on folly frenzy could beget,\nFruits of dull heat, and sooterkins of wit.\n\nNext, o\u2019er his books his eyes began to roll,\nIn pleasing memory of all he stole,\nHow here he sipped, how there he plundered snug\nAnd sucked all o\u2019er, like an industrious bug.\n\nHere lay poor Fletcher\u2019s half-eat scenes, and here\nThe frippery of crucified Moli\u00e8re;\nThere hapless Shakespeare, yet of Tibbald sore,\nWished he had blotted for himself before.\n\nThe rest on outside merit but

thy own importance know,\nNor bound thy narrow views to things below.\n\nSome secret truths from learned pride conceal'd,\nTo maids alone and children are reveal'd:\nWhat tho' no credit doubting wits may give?\n\nThe fair and innocent shall still believe.\n\nKnow then, unnumber'd spirits round thee fly,\nThe light militia of the lower sky;\nThese, though unseen, are ever on the wing,\nHang o'er the box, and hover round the Ring.\n\nThink what an equipage thou hast in air,\nAnd view with scorn two pages and a chair.\n\nAs now your own, our beings were of old,\nAnd once inclos'd in woman's beauteous mould;\nThence, by a soft transition, we repair\nFrom earthly vehicles to these of air.\n\nThink not, when woman's transient breath is fled,\nThat all her vanities at once are dead;\nSucceeding vanities she still regards,\nAnd tho' she plays no more, o'erlooks the cards.\n\nHer joy in gilded chariots, when alive,\nAnd love of ombre, after death survive.\n\nFor when the fair in all their pride expire,\nTo their first elements their souls retire:\nThe sprites of fiery termagants in flame\nMount up, and take a Salamander's name.\n\nSoft yielding minds to water glide away,\nAnd sip with Nymphs, their elemental tea.\n\nThe graver prude sinks downward to a Gnome,\nIn search of mischief still on earth to roam.\n\nThe light coquettes in Sylphs aloft repair,\nAnd sport and flutter in the fields of air.\n\nKnow further yet; whoever fair and chaste\nRejects mankind, is by some sylph embrac'd:\nFor spirits, freed from mortal laws, with ease\nAssume what sexes and what shapes they please.\n\nWhat guards the purity of melting maids,\nIn courtly balls, and midnight masquerades,\nSafe from the treach'rous friend, the daring spark,\nThe glance by day, the whisper in the dark,\nWhen kind occasion prompts their warm desires,\nWhen music softens, and when dancing fires?\n\n'Tis but their sylph, the wise celestials know,\nThough honour is the word with men below.\n\nSome nymphs there are, too conscious of their face,\nFor life predestin'd to the gnomes' embrace.\n\nThese swell their prospects and exalt their pride,\nWhen offers are disdain'd, and love denied:\nThen gay ideas crowd the vacant brain,\nWhile peers, and dukes, and all their sweeping train,\nAnd garters, stars, and coronets appear,\nAnd in soft sounds 'Your Grace' salutes their ear.\n\n'Tis these that early taint the female soul,\nInstruct the eyes of young coquettes to roll,\nTeach infant cheeks a bidden blush to know,\nAnd little hearts to flutter at a beau.\n\nOft, when the world imagine women stray,\nThe Sylphs through mystic mazes guide their way,\nThro' all the giddy circle they pursue,\nAnd old impertinence expel by new.\n\nWhat tender maid but must a victim fall\nTo one man's treat, but for another's ball?\n\nWhen Florio speaks, what virgin could withstand,\nIf gentle Damon did not squeeze her hand?\n\nWith varying vanities, from ev'ry part,\nThey shift the moving toyshop of their heart;\nWhere wigs with wigs, with sword-knots sword-knots strive,\nBeaux banish beaux, and coaches coaches drive.\n\nThis erring mortals levity may call,\nOh blind to truth! the Sylphs contrive it all.\n\nOf these am I, who thy protection claim,\nA watchful sprite, and Ariel is my name.\n\nLate, as I rang'd the crystal wilds of air,\nIn the clear mirror of thy ruling star\nI saw, alas! some dread event impend,\nEre to the main this morning sun descend,\nBut Heav'n reveals not what, or how, or where:\nWarn'd by the Sylph, oh pious maid, beware!\nThis to disclose is all thy guardian can.\n\nBeware of all, but most beware of man!\"\n\nHe said; when Shock, who thought she slept too long,\nLeap'd up, and wak'd his mistress with his tongue.\n\n'Twas then, Belinda, if report say true,\nThy eyes first open'd on a billet-doux;\nWounds, charms, and ardors were no sooner read,\nBut all the vision vanish'd from thy head.\n\nAnd now, unveil'd, the toilet stands display'd,\nEach silver vase in mystic order laid.\n\nFirst, rob'd in white, the nymph intent adores\nWith head uncover'd, the cosmetic pow'rs.\n\nA heav'nly image in the glass appears,\nTo that she bends, to that her eyes she rears;\nTh' inferior priestess, at her altar's side,\nTrembling, begins the sacred rites of pride.\n\nUnnumber'd treasures ope at once, and here\nThe various off'rings of the world appear;\nFrom each she nicely culls with curious toil,\nAnd decks the goddess with the glitt'ring spoil.\n\nThis casket India's glowing gems unlocks,\nAnd all Arabia breathes from yonder box.\n\nThe tortoise here and elephant unite,\nTransform'd to combs, the speckled and the white.\n\nHere files of pins extend their shining rows,\nPuffs, powders, patches, bibles, billet-doux.\n\nNow awful beauty puts on all its arms;\nThe fair each moment rises in her charms,\nRepairs her smiles, awakens ev'ry grace,\nAnd calls forth all the wonders of her face;\nSees by degrees a purer blush arise,\nAnd keener lightnings quicken in her eyes.\n\nThe busy Sylphs surround their darling care;\nThese set the head, and those divide the hair,\nSome fold the sleeve, whilst others plait the gown;\nAnd Betty's prais'd for labours not her own.", "period": "Neoclassical", "literary_movement": "Augustan", "register": "Satirical", "rhetorical_genre": "Forensic", "discursive_structure": "Argumentative", "discourse_type": "Prose", "narrative_level": "Extradiegetic", "diegetic_mimetic": NaN, "focalization": "Omniscient", "person": "Third person", "deictic_orientation": NaN, "addressee_type": "General", "deictic_object": NaN, "temporal_orientation": "Past", "temporal_structure": "Chronological", "tradition": "British", "mode": "Narrative", "genre": "Long Poem", "stanza_structure": "Quatrains", "meter": "Iambic pentameter", "rhyme": "AABB"}

Cyprian Queen.\n\nThe counsel for the fair began\nAccusing the false creature, man.\n\nThe brief with weighty crimes was charged,\nOn which the pleader much enlarged:\nThat Cupid now has lost his art,\nOr blunts the point of every dart;\nHis altar now no longer smokes;\nHis mother's aid no youth invokes\u2014\nThis tempts free-thinkers to refine,\nAnd bring in doubt their powers divine,\nNow love is dwindled to intrigue,\nAnd marriage grown a money-league.\n\nWhich crimes aforesaid (with her leave)\nWere (as he humbly did conceive)\nAgainst our Sovereign Lady's peace,\nAgainst the statutes in that case,\nAgainst her dignity and crown:\nThen prayed an answer and sat down.\n\nThe nymphs with scorn beheld their foes:\nWhen the defendant's counsel rose,\nAnd, what no lawyer ever lacked,\nWith impudence owned all the fact.\n\nBut, what the gentlest heart would vex,\nLaid all the fault on t'other sex.\n\nThat modern love is no such thing\nAs what those ancient poets sing;\nA fire celestial, chaste, refined,\nConceived and kindled in the mind,\nWhich having found an equal flame,\nUnites, and both become the same,\nIn different breasts together burn,\nTogether both to ashes turn.\n\nBut women now feel no such fire,\nAnd only know the gross desire;\nTheir passions move in lower spheres,\nWhere'er caprice or folly steers.\n\nA dog, a parrot, or an ape,\nOr some worse brute in human shape\nEngross the fancies of the fair,\nThe few soft moments they can spare\nFrom visits to receive and pay,\nFrom scandal, politics, and play,\nFrom fans, and flounces, and brocades,\nFrom equipage and park-parades,\nFrom all the thousand female toys,\nFrom every trifle that employs\nThe out or inside of their heads\nBetween their toilets and their beds.\n\nIn a dull stream, which, moving slow,\nYou hardly see the current flow,\nIf a small breeze obstructs the course,\nIt whirls about for want of force,\nAnd in its narrow circle gathers\nNothing but chaff, and straws, and feathers:\nThe current of a female mind\nStops thus, and turns with every wind;\nThus whirling round, together draws\nFools, fops, and rakes, for chaff and straws.\n\nHence we conclude, no women's hearts\nAre won by virtue, wit, and parts;\nNor are the men of sense to blame\nFor breasts incapable of flame:\nThe fault must on the nymphs be placed,\nGrown so corrupted in their taste.\n\nThe pleader having spoke his best,\nHad witness ready to attest,\nWho fairly could on oath depose,\nWhen questions on the fact arose,\nThat every article was true;\nNOR FURTHER THOSE DEPONENTS KNEW:\nTherefore he humbly would insist,\nThe bill might be with costs dismissed.\n\nThe cause appeared of so much weight,\nThat Venus from the judgment-seat\nDesired them not to talk so loud,\nElse she must interpose a cloud:\nFor if the heavenly folk should know\nThese pleadings in the Courts below,\nThat mortals here disdain to love,\nShe ne'er could show her face above.\n\nFor gods, their betters, are too wise\nTo value that which men despise.\n\n\"And then,\" said she, \"my son and I\nMust stroll in air 'twixt earth and sky:\nOr else, shut out from heaven and earth,\nFly to the sea, my place of birth;\nThere live with daggled mermaids pent,\nAnd keep on fish perpetual Lent.\n\nBut since the case appeared so nice,\nShe thought it best to take advice.\n\nThe Muses, by their king's permission,\nThough foes to love, attend the session,\nAnd on the right hand took their places\nIn order; on the left, the Graces:\nTo whom she might her doubts propose\nOn all emergencies that rose.\n\nThe Muses oft were seen to frown;\nThe Graces half ashamed look down;\nAnd 'twas observed, there were but few\nOf either sex, among the crew,\nWhom she or her assessors knew.\n\nThe goddess soon began to see\nThings were not ripe for a decree,\nAnd said she must consult her books,\nThe lovers' Fletas, Bractons, Cokes.\n\nFirst to a dapper clerk she beckoned,\nTo turn to Ovid, book the second;\nShe then referred them to a place\nIn Virgil (VIDE Dido's case);\nAs for Tibullus's reports,\nThey never passed for law in Courts:\nFor Cowley's brief, and pleas of Waller,\nStill their authority is smaller.\n\nThere was on both sides much to say;\nShe'd hear the cause another day;\nAnd so she did, and then a third,\nShe heard it\u2014 there she kept her word;\nBut with rejoinders and replies,\nLong bills, and answers, stuffed with lies\nDemur, imparlance, and essoign,\nThe parties ne'er could issue join:\nFor sixteen years the cause was spun,\nAnd then stood where it first begun.\n\nNow, gentle Clio, sing or say,\nWhat Venus meant by this delay.\n\nThe goddess, much perplexed in mind,\nTo see her empire thus declined,\nWhen first this grand debate arose\nAbove her wisdom to compose,\nConceived a project in her head,\nTo work her ends; which, if it sped,\nWould show the merits of the cause\nFar better than consulting laws.\n\nIn a glad hour Lucina's aid\nProduced on earth a wondrous maid,\nOn whom the queen of love was bent\nTo try a new experiment.\n\nShe threw her law-books on the shelf,\nAnd thus debated with herself:-\n\"Since men allege they ne'er can find\nThose beauties in a female mind\nWhich raise a flame that will endure\nFor ever, uncorrupt and pure;\nIf 'tis with reason they complain,\nThis infant shall restore my reign.\n\nI'll search where every virtue dwells,\nFrom Courts inclusive down to cells.\n\nWhat preachers talk, or sages write,\nThese I will gather and unite,\nAnd represent them to mankind\nCollected in that infant's mind.\n\nThis said, she plucks in heaven's high bowers\nA sprig of Amaranthine flowers,\nIn nectar thrice infuses bays,\nThree times refined in Titan's rays:\nThen calls the Graces to her aid,\nAnd sprinkles thrice the now-born maid.\n\nFrom whence the tender skin assumes\nA sweetness above all perfumes;\nFrom whence a cleanliness remains,\nIncapable of outward stains;\nFrom whence that decency of mind,\nSo lovely in a female kind.\n\nWhere not one careless thought intrudes\nLess modest than the speech of prudes;\nWhere never blush was called in aid,\nThe spurious virtue in a maid,\nA virtue but at second-hand;\nThey blush because they understand.\n\nThe Graces next would act their part,\nAnd show but little of their art;\nTheir work was half already done,\nThe child with native beauty shone,\nThe outward form no help required:\nEach breathing on her thrice, inspired\nThat gentle, soft, engaging air\nWhich in old times adorned the fair,\nAnd said, \"Vanessa be the name\nBy which thou shalt be known to fame;\nVanessa, by the gods enrolled:\nHer name on earth\u2014 shall not be told.\n\nBut still the work was not complete,\nWhen Venus thought on a deceit:\nDrawn by her doves, away she flies,\nAnd finds out Pallas in the skies:\nDear Pallas, I have been this morn\nTo see a lovely infant born:\nA boy in yonder isle below,\nSo like my own without his bow,\nBy beauty could your heart be won,\nYou'd swear it is Apollo's son;\nBut it shall ne'er be said, a child\nSo hopeful has by me been spoiled;\nI have enough besides to spare,\nAnd give him wholly to your care.\n\nWisdom's above suspecting wiles;\nThe queen of learning gravely smiles,\nDown from Olympus comes with joy,\nMistakes Vanessa for a boy;\nThen sows within her tender mind\nSeeds long unknown to womankind;\nFor manly bosoms chiefly fit,\nThe seeds of knowledge, judgment, wit,\nHer soul was suddenly endued\nWith justice, truth, and fortitude;\nWith honour, which no breath can stain,\nWhich malice must attack in vain:\nWith open heart and bounteous hand:\nBut Pallas here was at a stand;\nShe know in our degenerate days\nBare virtue could not live on praise,\nThat meat must be with money bought:\nShe therefore, upon second thought,\nInfused yet as it were by stealth,\nSome small regard for state and wealth:\nOf which as she grew up there stayed\nA tincture in the prudent maid:\nShe managed her estate with care,\nYet liked three footmen to her chair,\nBut lest he should neglect his studies\nLike a young heir, the thrifty goddess\n(For fear young master should be spoiled)\nWould use him like a younger child;\nAnd, after long computing, found\n'Twould come to just five thousand pound.\n\nThe Queen of Love was pleased and proud\nTo we Vanessa thus endowed;\nShe doubted not but such a dame\nThrough every breast would dart a flame;\nThat every rich and lordly swain\nWith pride would drag about her chain;\nThat scholars would forsake their books\nTo study bright Vanessa's looks:\nAs she advanced that womankind\nWould by her model form their mind,\nAnd all their conduct would be tried\nBy her, as an unerring guide.\n\nOffending daughters oft would hear\nVanessa's praise rung in their ear:\nMiss Betty, when she does a fault,\nLets fall her knife, or spills the salt,\nWill thus be by her mother chid,\n\"'Tis what Vanessa never did.\n\nThus by the nymphs and swains adored,\nMy power shall be again restored,\nAnd happy lovers bless my reign\u2014\nSo Venus hoped, but hoped in vain.\n\nFor when in time the martial maid\nFound out the trick that Venus played,\nShe shakes her helm, she knits her brows,\nAnd fired with indignation, vows\nTo-morrow, ere the setting sun,\nShe'd all undo that she had done.\n\nBut in the poets we may find\nA wholesome law, time out of mind,\nHad been confirmed by Fate's decree;\nThat gods, of whatso'er degree,\nResume not what themselves have given,\nOr any brother-god in Heaven;\nWhich keeps the peace among the gods,\nOr they must always be at odds.\n\nAnd Pallas, if she broke the laws,\nMust yield her foe the stronger cause;\nA shame to one so much adored\nFor Wisdom, at Jove's council-board.\n\nBesides, she feared the queen of love\nWould meet with better friends above.\n\nAnd though she must with grief reflect\nTo see a mortal virgin deck'd\nWith graces hitherto unknown\nTo female breasts, except her own,\nYet she would act as best became\nA goddess of unspotted fame;\nShe knew, by augury divine,\nVenus would fail in her design:\nShe studied well the point, and found\nHer foe's conclusions were not sound,\nFrom premises erroneous brought,\nAnd therefore the deduction's nought,\nAnd must have contrary effects\nTo what her treacherous foe expects.\n\nIn proper season Pallas meets\nThe queen of love, whom thus she greets\n(For Gods, we are by Homer told,\nCan in celestial language scold),\n\"Perfidious Goddess! but in vain\nYou formed this project in your brain,\nA project for thy talents fit,\nWith much deceit, and little wit;\nThou hast, as thou shalt quickly see,\nDeceived thyself instead of me;\nFor how can heavenly wisdom prove\nAn instrument to earthly love?\n\nKnow'st thou not yet that men commence\nThy votaries, for want of sense?\n\nNor shall Vanessa be the theme\nTo manage thy abortive scheme;\nShe'll prove the greatest of thy foes,\nAnd yet I scorn to interpose,\nBut using neither skill nor force,\nLeave all things to their natural course.\n\nThe goddess thus pronounced her doom,\nWhen, lo, Vanessa in her bloom,\nAdvanced like Atalanta's star,\nBut rarely seen, and seen from far:\nIn a new world with caution stepped,\nWatched all the company she kept,\nWell knowing from the books she read\nWhat dangerous paths young virgins tread;\nWould seldom at the park appear,\nNor saw the play-house twice a year;\nYet not incurious, was inclined\nTo know the converse of mankind.\n\nFirst issued from perfumers' shops\nA crowd of fashionable fops;\nThey liked her how she liked the play?\n\nThen told the tattle of the day,\nA duel fought last night at two\nAbout a lady\u2014 you know who;\nMentioned a new Italian, come\nEither from Muscovy or Rome;\nGave hints of who and who's together;\nThen fell to talking of the weather:\nLast night was so extremely fine,\nThe ladies walked till after nine.\n\nThen in soft voice, and speech absurd,\nWith nonsense every second word,\nWith fustian from exploded plays,\nThey celebrate her beauty's praise,\nRun o'er their cant of stupid lies,\nAnd tell the murders of her eyes.\n\nWith silent scorn Vanessa sat,\nScarce list'ning to their idle chat;\nFurther than sometimes by a frown,\nWhen they grew pert, to pull them down.\n\nAt last she spitefully was bent\nTo try their wisdom's full extent;\nAnd said, she valued nothing less\nThan titles, figure, shape, and dress;\nThat merit should be chiefly placed\nIn judgment, knowledge, wit, and taste;\nAnd these, she offered to dispute,\nAlone distinguished man from brute:\nThat present times have no pretence\nTo virtue, in the noble sense\nBy Greeks and Romans understood,\nTo perish for our country's good.\n\nShe named the ancient heroes round,\nExplained for what they were renowned;\nThen spoke with censure, or applause,\nOf foreign customs, rites, and laws;\nThrough nature and through art she ranged,\nAnd gracefully her subject changed:\nIn vain; her hearers had no share\nIn all she spoke, except to stare.\n\nTheir judgment was upon the whole,\n\u2014 That lady is the dullest soul\u2014\nThen tipped their forehead in a jeer,\nAs who should say\u2014 she wants it here;\nShe may be handsome, young, and rich,\nBut none will burn her for a witch.\n\nA party next of glittering dames,\nFrom round the purlieus of St.\n\nJames,\nCame early, out of pure goodwill,\nTo see the girl in deshabille.\n\nTheir clamour 'lighting from their chairs,\nGrew louder, all the way up stairs;\nAt entrance loudest, where they found\nThe room with volumes littered round,\nVanessa held Montaigne, and read,\nWhilst Mrs.\n\nSusan combed her head:\nThey called for tea and chocolate,\nAnd fell into their usual chat,\nDiscoursing with important face,\nOn ribbons, fans, and gloves, and lace:\nShowed patterns just from India brought,\nAnd gravely asked her what she thought,\nWhether the red or green were best,\nAnd what they cost?\n\nVanessa guessed,\nAs came into her fancy first,\nNamed half the rates, and liked the worst.\n\nTo scandal next\u2014 What awkward thing\nWas that, last Sunday, in the ring?\n\nI'm sorry Mopsa breaks so fast;\nI said her face would never last,\nCorinna with that youthful air,\nIs thirty, and a bit to spare.\n\nHer fondness for a certain earl\nBegan, when I was but a girl.\n\nPhyllis, who but a month ago\nWas married to the Tunbridge beau,\nI saw coquetting t'other night\nIn public with that odious knight.\n\nThey rallied next Vanessa's dress;\nThat gown was made for old Queen Bess.\n\nDear madam, let me set your head;\nDon't you intend to put on red?\n\nA petticoat without a hoop!\nSure, you are not ashamed to stoop;\nWith handsome garters at your knees,\nNo matter what a fellow sees.\n\nFilled with disdain, with rage inflamed,\nBoth of herself and sex ashamed,\nThe nymph stood silent out of spite,\nNor would vouchsafe to set them right.\n\nAway the fair detractors went,\nAnd gave, by turns, their censures vent.\n\nShe's not so handsome in my eyes:\nFor wit, I wonder where it lies.\n\nShe's fair and clean, and that's the most;\nBut why proclaim her for a toast?\n\nA baby face, no life, no airs,\nBut what she learnt at country fairs.\n\nScarce knows what difference is between\nRich Flanders lace, and Colberteen.\n\nI'll undertake my little Nancy,\nIn flounces has a better fancy.\n\nWith all her wit, I would not ask\nHer judgment, how to buy a mask.\n\nWe begged her but to patch her face,\nShe never hit one proper place;\nWhich every girl at five years old\nCan do as soon as she is told.\n\nI own, that out-of-fashion stuff\nBecomes the creature well enough.\n\nThe girl might pass, if we could get her\nTo know the world a little better.\n\n(TO KNOW THE WORLD! a modern phrase\nFor visits, ombre, balls, and plays.\n\nThus, to the world's perpetual shame,\nThe queen of beauty lost her aim,\nToo late with grief she understood\nPallas had done more harm than good;\nFor great examples are but vain,\nWhere ignorance begets disdain.\n\nBoth sexes, armed with guilt and spite,\nAgainst Vanessa's power unite;\nTo copy her few nymphs aspired;\nHer virtues fewer swains admired;\nSo stars, beyond a certain height,\nGive mortals neither heat nor light.\n\nYet some of either sex, endowed\nWith gifts superior to the crowd,\nWith virtue, knowledge, taste, and wit,\nShe condescended to admit;\nWith pleasing arts she could reduce\nMen's talents to their proper use;\nAnd with address each genius hold\nTo that wherein it most excelled;\nThus making others' wisdom known,\nCould please them and improve her own.\n\nA modest youth said something new,\nShe placed it in the strongest view.\n\nAll humble worth she strove to raise;\nWould not be praised, yet loved to praise.\n\nThe learned met with free approach,\nAlthough they came not in a coach.\n\nSome clergy too she would allow,\nNor quarreled at their awkward bow.\n\nBut this was for Cadenus' sake;\nA gownman of a different make.\n\nWhom Pallas, once Vanessa's tutor,\nHad fixed on for her coadjutor.\n\nBut Cupid, full of mischief, longs\nTo vindicate his mother's wrongs.\n\nOn Pallas all attempts are vain;\nOne way he knows to give her pain;\nVows on Vanessa's heart to take\nDue vengeance, for her patron's sake.\n\nThose early seeds by Venus sown,\nIn spite of Pallas, now were grown;\nAnd Cupid hoped they would improve\nBy time, and ripen into love.\n\nThe boy made use of all his craft,\nIn vain discharging many a shaft,\nPointed at colonels, lords, and beaux;\nCadenus warded off the blows,\nFor placing still some book betwixt,\nThe darts were in the cover fixed,\nOr often blunted and recoiled,\nOn Plutarch's morals struck, were spoiled.\n\nThe queen of wisdom could foresee,\nBut not prevent the Fates decree;\nAnd human caution tries in vain\nTo break that adamantine chain.\n\nVanessa, though by Pallas taught,\nBy love invulnerable thought,\nSearching in books for wisdom's aid,\nWas, in the very search, betrayed.\n\nCupid, though all his darts were lost,\nYet still resolved to spare no cost;\nHe could not answer to his fame\nThe triumphs of that stubborn dame,\nA nymph so hard to be subdued,\nWho neither was coquette nor prude.\n\nI find, says he, she wants a doctor,\nBoth to adore her, and instruct her:\nI'll give her what she most admires,\nAmong those venerable sires.\n\nCadenus is a subject fit,\nGrown old in politics and wit;\nCaressed by Ministers of State,\nOf half mankind the dread and hate.\n\nWhate'er vexations love attend,\nShe need no rivals apprehend\nHer sex, with universal voice,\nMust laugh at her capricious choice.\n\nCadenus many things had writ,\nVanessa much esteemed his wit,\nAnd called for his poetic works!\nMeantime the boy in secret lurks.\n\nAnd while the book was in her hand,\nThe urchin from his private stand\nTook aim, and shot with all his strength\nA dart of such prodigious length,\nIt pierced the feeble volume through,\nAnd deep transfixed her bosom too.\n\nSome lines, more moving than the rest,\nStruck to the point that pierced her breast;\nAnd, borne directly to the heart,\nWith pains unknown, increased her smart.\n\nVanessa, not in years a score,\nDreams of a gown of forty-four;\nImaginary charms can find,\nIn eyes with reading almost blind;\nCadenus now no more appears\nDeclined in health, advanced in years.\n\nShe fancies music in his tongue,\nNor farther looks, but thinks him young.\n\nWhat mariner is not afraid\nTo venture in a ship decayed?\n\nWhat planter will attempt to yoke\nA sapling with a falling oak?\n\nAs years increase, she brighter shines,\nCadenus with each day declines,\nAnd he must fall a prey to Time,\nWhile she continues in her prime.\n\nCadenus, common forms apart,\nIn every scene had kept his heart;\nHad sighed and languished, vowed and writ,\nFor pastime, or to show his wit;\nBut time, and books, and State affairs,\nHad spoiled his fashionable airs,\nHe now could praise, esteem, approve,\nBut understood not what was love.\n\nHis conduct might have made him styled\nA father, and the nymph his child.\n\nThat innocent delight he took\nTo see the virgin mind her book,\nWas but the master's secret joy\nIn school to hear the finest boy.\n\nHer knowledge with her fancy grew,\nShe hourly pressed for something new;\nIdeas came into her mind\nSo fact, his lessons lagged behind;\nShe reasoned, without plodding long,\nNor ever gave her judgment wrong.\n\nBut now a sudden change was wrought,\nShe minds no longer what he taught.\n\nCadenus was amazed to find\nSuch marks of a distracted mind;\nFor though she seemed to listen more\nTo all he spoke, than e'er before.\n\nHe found her thoughts would absent range,\nYet guessed not whence could spring the change.\n\nAnd first he modestly conjectures,\nHis pupil might be tired with lectures,\nWhich helped to mortify his pride,\nYet gave him not the heart to chide;\nBut in a mild dejected strain,\nAt last he ventured to complain:\nSaid, she should be no longer teased,\nMight have her freedom when she pleased;\nWas now convinced he acted wrong,\nTo hide her from the world so long,\nAnd in dull studies to engage\nOne of her tender sex and age.\n\nThat every nymph with envy owned,\nHow she might shine in the GRANDE-MONDE,\nAnd every shepherd was undone,\nTo see her cloistered like a nun.\n\nThis was a visionary scheme,\nHe waked, and found it but a dream;\nA project far above his skill,\nFor Nature must be Nature still.\n\nIf she was bolder than became\nA scholar to a courtly dame,\nShe might excuse a man of letters;\nThus tutors often treat their betters,\nAnd since his talk offensive grew,\nHe came to take his last adieu.\n\nVanessa, filled with just disdain,\nWould still her dignity maintain,\nInstructed from her early years\nTo scorn the art of female tears.\n\nHad he employed his time so long,\nTo teach her what was right or wrong,\nYet could such notions entertain,\nThat all his lectures were in vain?\n\nShe owned the wand'ring of her thoughts,\nBut he must answer for her faults.\n\nShe well remembered, to her cost,\nThat all his lessons were not lost.\n\nTwo maxims she could still produce,\nAnd sad experience taught her use;\nThat virtue, pleased by being shown,\nKnows nothing which it dare not own;\nCan make us without fear disclose\nOur inmost secrets to our foes;\nThat common forms were not designed\nDirectors to a noble mind.\n\nNow, said the nymph, I'll let you see\nMy actions with your rules agree,\nThat I can vulgar forms despise,\nAnd have no secrets to disguise.\n\nI knew by what you said and writ,\nHow dangerous things were men of wit;\nYou cautioned me against their charms,\nBut never gave me equal arms;\nYour lessons found the weakest part,\nAimed at the head, but reached the heart.\n\nCadenus felt within him rise\nShame, disappointment, guilt, surprise.\n\nHe know not how to reconcile\nSuch language, with her usual style:\nAnd yet her words were so expressed,\nHe could not hope she spoke in jest.\n\nHis thoughts had wholly been confined\nTo form and cultivate her mind.\n\nHe hardly knew, till he was told,\nWhether the nymph were young or old;\nHad met her in a public place,\nWithout distinguishing her face,\nMuch less could his declining age\nVanessa's earliest thoughts engage.\n\nAnd if her youth indifference met,\nHis person must contempt beget,\nOr grant her passion be sincere,\nHow shall his innocence be clear?\n\nAppearances were all so strong,\nThe world must think him in the wrong;\nWould say he made a treach'rous use.\n\nOf wit, to flatter and seduce;\nThe town would swear he had betrayed,\nBy magic spells, the harmless maid;\nAnd every beau would have his jokes,\nThat scholars were like other folks;\nThat when Platonic flights were over,\nThe tutor turned a mortal lover.\n\nSo tender of the young and fair;\nIt showed a true paternal care\u2014\nFive thousand guineas in her purse;\nThe doctor might have fancied worst,\u2014\nHardly at length he silence broke,\nAnd faltered every word he spoke;\nInterpreting her complaisance,\nJust as a man sans consequence.\n\nShe rallied well, he always knew;\nHer manner now was something new;\nAnd what she spoke was in an air,\nAs serious as a tragic player.\n\nBut those who aim at ridicule,\nShould fix upon some certain rule,\nWhich fairly hints they are in jest,\nElse he must enter his protest;\nFor let a man be ne'er so wise,\nHe may be caught with sober lies;\nA science which he never taught,\nAnd, to be free, was dearly bought;\nFor, take it in its proper light,\n'Tis just what coxcombs call a bite.\n\nBut not to dwell on things minute,\nVanessa finished the dispute,\nBrought weighty arguments to prove,\nThat reason was her guide in love.\n\nShe thought he had himself described,\nHis doctrines when she fist imbibed;\nWhat he had planted now was grown,\nHis virtues she might call her own;\nAs he approves, as he dislikes,\nLove or contempt her fancy strikes.\n\nSelf-love in nature rooted fast,\nAttends us first, and leaves us last:\nWhy she likes him, admire not at her,\nShe loves herself, and that's the matter.\n\nHow was her tutor wont to praise\nThe geniuses of ancient days!\n(Those authors he so oft had named\nFor learning, wit, and wisdom famed).\n\nWas struck with love, esteem, and awe,\nFor persons whom he never saw.\n\nSuppose Cadenus flourished then,\nHe must adore such God-like men.\n\nIf one short volume could comprise\nAll that was witty, learned, and wise,\nHow would it be esteemed, and read,\nAlthough the writer long were dead?\n\nIf such an author were alive,\nHow all would for his friendship strive;\nAnd come in crowds to see his face?\n\nAnd this she takes to be her case.\n\nCadenus answers every end,\nThe book, the author, and the friend,\nThe utmost her desires will reach,\nIs but to learn what he can teach;\nHis converse is a system fit\nAlone to fill up all her wit;\nWhile ev'ry passion of her mind\nIn him is centred and confined.\n\nLove can with speech inspire a mute,\nAnd taught Vanessa to dispute.\n\nThis topic, never touched before,\nDisplayed her eloquence the more:\nHer knowledge, with such pains acquired,\nBy this new passion grew inspired.\n\nThrough this she made all objects pass,\nWhich gave a tincture o'er the mass;\nAs rivers, though they bend and twine,\nStill to the sea their course incline;\nOr, as philosophers, who find\nSome fav'rite system to their mind,\nIn every point to make it fit,\nWill force all nature to submit.\n\nCadenus, who could ne'er suspect\nHis lessons would have such effect,\nOr be so artfully applied,\nInsensibly came on her side;\nIt was an unforeseen event,\nThings took a turn he never meant.\n\nWhoe'er excels in what we prize,\nAppears a hero to our eyes;\nEach girl, when pleased with what is taught,\nWill have the teacher in her thought.\n\nWhen miss delights in her spinnet,\nA fiddler may a fortune get;\nA blockhead, with melodious voice\nIn boarding-schools can have his choice;\nAnd oft the dancing-master's art\nClimbs from the toe to touch the heart.\n\nIn learning let a nymph delight,\nThe pedant gets a mistress by't.\n\nCadenus, to his grief and shame,\nCould scarce oppose Vanessa's flame;\nBut though her arguments were strong,\nAt least could hardly with them wrong.\n\nHowe'er it came, he could not tell,\nBut, sure, she never talked so well.\n\nHis pride began to interpose,\nPreferred before a crowd of beaux,\nSo bright a nymph to come unsought,\nSuch wonder by his merit wrought;\n'Tis merit must with her prevail,\nHe never know her judgment fail.\n\nShe noted all she ever read,\nAnd had a most discerning head.\n\n'Tis an old maxim in the schools,\nThat vanity's the food of fools;\nYet now and then your men of wit\nWill condescend to take a bit.\n\nSo when Cadenus could not hide,\nHe chose to justify his pride;\nConstruing the passion she had shown,\nMuch to her praise, more to his own.\n\nNature in him had merit placed,\nIn her, a most judicious taste.\n\nLove, hitherto a transient guest,\nNe'er held possession in his breast;\nSo long attending at the gate,\nDisdain'd to enter in so late.\n\nLove, why do we one passion call?\n\nWhen 'tis a compound of them all;\nWhere hot and cold, where sharp and sweet,\nIn all their equipages meet;\nWhere pleasures mixed with pains appear,\nSorrow with joy, and hope with fear.\n\nWherein his dignity and age\nForbid Cadenus to engage.\n\nBut friendship in its greatest height,\nA constant, rational delight,\nOn virtue's basis fixed to last,\nWhen love's allurements long are past;\nWhich gently warms, but cannot burn;\nHe gladly offers in return;\nHis want of passion will redeem,\nWith gratitude, respect, esteem;\nWith that devotion we bestow,\nWhen goddesses appear below.\n\nWhile thus Cadenus entertains\nVanessa in exalted strains,\nThe nymph in sober words intreats\nA truce with all sublime conceits.\n\nFor why such raptures, flights, and fancies,\nTo her who durst not read romances;\nIn lofty style to make replies,\nWhich he had taught her to despise?\n\nBut when her tutor will affect\nDevotion, duty, and respect,\nHe fairly abdicates his throne,\nThe government is now her own;\nHe has a forfeiture incurred,\nShe vows to take him at his word,\nAnd hopes he will not take it strange\nIf both should now their stations change\nThe nymph will have her turn, to be\nThe tutor; and the pupil he:\nThough she already can discern\nHer scholar is not apt to learn;\nOr wants capacity to reach\nThe science she designs to teach;\nWherein his genius was below\nThe skill of every common beau;\nWho, though he cannot spell, is wise\nEnough to read a lady's eyes?\n\nAnd will each accidental glance\nInterpret for a kind advance.\n\nBut what success Vanessa met\nIs to the world a secret yet;\nWhether the nymph, to please her swain,\nTalks in a high romantic strain;\nOr whether he at last descends\nTo like with less seraphic ends;\nOr to compound the bus'ness, whether\nThey temper love and books together;\nMust never to mankind be told,\nNor shall the conscious muse unfold.\n\nMeantime the mournful queen of love\nLed but a weary life above.\n\nShe ventures now to leave the skies,\nGrown by Vanessa's conduct wise.\n\nFor though by one perverse event\nPallas had crossed her first intent,\nThough her design was not obtained,\nYet had she much experience gained;\nAnd, by the project vainly tried,\nCould better now the cause decide.\n\nShe gave due notice that both parties,\nCORAM REGINA PROX' DIE MARTIS,\nShould at their peril without fail\nCome and appear, and save their bail.\n\nAll met, and silence thrice proclaimed,\nOne lawyer to each side was named.\n\nThe judge discovered in her face\nResentments for her late disgrace;\nAnd, full of anger, shame, and grief,\nDirected them to mind their brief;\nNor spend their time to show their reading,\nShe'd have a summary proceeding.\n\nShe gathered under every head,\nThe sum of what each lawyer said;\nGave her own reasons last; and then\nDecreed the cause against the men.\n\nBut, in a weighty case like this,\nTo show she did not judge amiss,\nWhich evil tongues might else report,\nShe made a speech in open court;\nWherein she grievously complains,\n\"How she was cheated by the swains.\n\nOn whose petition (humbly showing\nThat women were not worth the wooing,\nAnd that unless the sex would mend,\nThe race of lovers soon must end);\n\"She was at Lord knows what expense,\nTo form a nymph of wit and sense;\nA model for her sex designed,\nWho never could one lover find,\nShe saw her favour was misplaced;\nThe follows had a wretched taste;\nShe needs must tell them to their face,\nThey were a senseless, stupid race;\nAnd were she to begin again,\nShe'd study to reform the men;\nOr add some grains of folly more\nTo women than they had before.\n\nTo put them on an equal foot;\nAnd this, or nothing else, would do't.\n\nThis might their mutual fancy strike,\nSince every being loves its like.\n\nBut now, repenting what was done,\nShe left all business to her son;\nShe puts the world in his possession,\nAnd let him use it at discretion.\n\nThe crier was ordered to dismiss\nThe court, so made his last O yes!\nThe goddess would no longer wait,\nBut rising from her chair of state,\nLeft all below at six and seven,\nHarnessed her doves, and flew to Heaven.\n", "period": "Neoclassical", "literary_movement": "",

it here;\nWhile Alfred\u2019s name, the father of his age,\nAnd the Sixth Edward\u2019s grace the historic page.\n\nA.\n\nKings, then, at last have but the lot of all:\nBy their own conduct they must stand or fall.\n\nB.\n\nTrue.\n\nWhile they live, the courtly laureate pays\nHis quitrent ode, his peppercorn of praise,\nAnd many a dunce, whose fingers itch to write,\nAdds, as he can, his tributary mite:\nA subject\u2019s faults a subject may proclaim,\nA monarch\u2019s errors are forbidden game!\nThus, free from censure, overawed by fear,\nAnd praised for virtues that they scorn to wear,\nThe fleeting forms of\u00a0 majesty engage\nRespect, while stalking o\u2019er life\u2019s narrow stage:\nThen leave their crimes for history to scan,\nAnd ask, with busy scorn, Was this the man?\n\nI pity kings, whom worship waits upon,\nObsequious from the cradle to the throne;\nBefore whose infant eyes the flatterer bows,\nAnd binds a wreath about their baby brows:\nWhom education stiffens into state,\nAnd death awakens from that dream too late.\n\nOh! if servility with supple knees,\nWhose trade it is to smile, to crouch, to please;\nIf smooth dissimulation skill\u2019d to grace\nA devil\u2019s purpose with an angel\u2019s face;\nIf smiling peeresses and simpering peers,\nEncompassing his throne a few short years;\nIf the gilt carriage and the pamper\u2019d steed,\nThat wants no driving, and disdains the lead;\nIf guards, mechanically form\u2019d in ranks,\nPlaying, at beat of drum, their martial pranks,\nShouldering and standing as if stuck to stone,\nWhile condescending majesty looks on\u2014\nIf monarchy consist in such base things,\nSighing, I say again, I pity kings!\nTo be suspected, thwarted, and withstood,\nE\u2019en when he labours for his country\u2019s good;\nTo see a band call\u2019d patriot for no cause,\nBut that they catch at popular applause,\nCareless of all the anxiety he feels,\nHook disappointment on the public wheels;\nWith all their flippant fluency of tongue,\nMost confident, when palpably most wrong\u2014\nIf this be kingly, then farewell for me\nAll kingship, and may I be poor and free!\nTo be the Table Talk of clubs up-stairs,\nTo which the unwash\u2019d artificer repairs,\nTo indulge his genius after long fatigue,\nBy diving into cabinet intrigue\u2014\n(For what kings deem a toil, as well they may,\nTo him is relaxation, and mere play);\nTo win no praise when well-wrought plans prevail,\nBut to be rudely censured when they fail;\nTo doubt the love his favourites may pretend,\nAnd in reality to find no friend;\nIf he indulge a cultivated taste,\nHis galleries with the works of art well graced,\nTo hear it call\u2019d extravagance and waste;\u2014\nIf these attendants, and if such as these,\nMust follow royalty, then welcome ease;\nHowever humble and confined the sphere,\nHappy the state that has not these to fear!\nA.\n\nThus men, whose thoughts contemplative have dwelt\nOn situations that they never felt,\nStart up sagacious, cover\u2019d with the dust\nOf dreaming study and pedantic rust,\nAnd prate and preach about what others prove,\nAs if the world and they were hand and glove.\n\nLeave kingly backs to cope with kingly cares;\nThey have their weight to carry, subjects theirs;\nPoets, of all men, ever least regret\nIncreasing taxes and the nation\u2019s debt.\n\nCould you contrive the payment, and rehearse\nThe mighty plan, oracular, in verse,\nNo bard, howe\u2019er majestic, old or new,\nShould claim my fix\u2019d attention more than you.\n\nB.\n\nNot Brindley nor Bridgewater would essay\nTo turn the course of Helicon that way:\nNor would the Nine consent the sacred tide\nShould purl amidst the traffic of Cheapside,\nOr tinkle in \u2018Change Alley, to amuse\nThe leathern ears of stockjobbers and Jews.\n\nA.\n\nVouchsafe, at least, to pitch the key of rhyme\nTo themes more pertinent, if less sublime.\n\nWhen ministers and ministerial arts;\nPatriots, who love good places at their hearts;\nWhen admirals, extoll\u2019d for standing still,\nOr doing nothing with a deal of skill;\nGenerals, who will not conquer when they may,\nFirm friends to peace, to pleasure, and good pay;\nWhen Freedom, wounded almost to despair,\nThough discontent alone can find out where\u2014\nWhen themes like these employ the poet\u2019s tongue,\nI hear as mute as if a syren sung.\n\nOr tell me, if you can, what power maintains\nA Briton\u2019s scorn of arbitrary chains?\n\nThat were a theme might animate the dead,\nAnd move the lips of poets cast in lead.\n\nB.\n\nThe cause, though worth the search, may yet elude\nConjecture and remark, however shrewd.\n\nThey take, perhaps, a well-directed aim,\nWho seek it in his climate and his frame.\n\nLiberal in all things else, yet Nature here\nWith stern severity deals out the year.\n\nWinter invades the spring, and often pours\nA chilling flood on summer\u2019s drooping flowers;\nUnwelcome vapours quench autumnal beams,\nUngenial blasts attending curl the streams:\nThe peasants urge their harvest, ply the fork\nWith double toil, and shiver at their work:\nThus with a rigour, for his good design\u2019d,\nShe rears her favourite man of all mankind.\n\nHis form robust, and of elastic tone,\nProportion\u2019d well, half muscle and half bone,\nSupplies with warm activity and force\nA mind well lodged, and masculine of course.\n\nHence Liberty, sweet Liberty inspires\nAnd keeps alive his fierce but noble fires.\n\nPatient of constitutional control,\nHe bears it with meek manliness of soul;\nBut, if authority grow wanton, woe\nTo him that treads upon his free-born toe!\nOne step beyond the boundary of the laws,\nFires him at once in Freedom\u2019s glorious cause.\n\nThus proud Prerogative, not much revered,\nIs seldom felt, though sometimes seen and heard;\nAnd in his cage, like parrot fine and gay,\nIs kept to strut, look big, and talk away.\n\nBorn in a climate softer far than ours,\nNor form\u2019d like us, with such Herculean powers,\nThe Frenchman, easy, debonair, and brisk,\nGive him his lass, his fiddle, and his frisk,\nIs always happy, reign whoever may,\nAnd laughs the sense of misery far away:\nHe drinks his simple beverage with a gust;\nAnd, feasting on an onion and a crust,\nWe never feel the alacrity and joy\nWith which he shouts and carols, Vive le Roi!\nFill\u2019d with as much true merriment and glee\nAs if he heard his king say\u2014Slave, be free.\n\nThus happiness depends, as Nature shews,\nLess on exterior things than most suppose.\n\nVigilant over all that he has made,\nKind Providence attends with gracious aid;\nBids equity throughout his works prevail,\nAnd weighs the nations in an even scale;\nHe can encourage slavery to a smile,\nAnd fill with discontent a British isle.\n\nA.\n\nFreeman and slave, then, if the case be such,\nStand on a level; and you prove too much:\nIf all men indiscriminately share\nHis fostering power, and tutelary care,\nAs well be yoked by Despotism\u2019s hand,\nAs dwell at large in Britain\u2019s charter\u2019d land.\n\nB.\n\nNo.\n\nFreedom has a thousand charms to shew,\nThat slaves, howe\u2019er contented, never know.\n\nThe mind attains beneath her happy reign\nThe growth that Nature meant she should attain;\nThe varied fields of science, ever new,\nOpening and wider opening on her view,\nShe ventures onward with a prosperous force,\nWhile no base fear impedes her in her course:\nReligion, richest favour of the skies,\nStands most reveal\u2019d before the freeman\u2019s eyes;\nNo shades of superstition blot the day,\nLiberty chases all that gloom away.\n\nThe soul, emancipated, unoppress\u2019d,\nFree to prove all things and hold fast the best,\nLearns much; and to a thousand list\u2019ning minds\nCommunicates with joy the good she finds;\nCourage in arms, and ever prompt to shew\nHis manly forehead to the fiercest foe;\nGlorious in war, but for the sake of peace,\nHis spirits rising as his toils increase,\nGuards well what arts and industry have won,\nAnd Freedom claims him for her first-born son.\n\nSlaves fight for what were better cast away\u2014\nThe chain that binds them, and a tyrant\u2019s sway;\nBut they that fight for freedom undertake\nThe noblest cause mankind can have at stake:\nReligion, virtue, truth, whate\u2019er we call\nA blessing\u2014freedom is the pledge of all.\n\nO Liberty! the prisoner\u2019s pleasing dream,\nThe poet\u2019s muse, his passion, and his theme;\nGenius is thine, and thou art Fancy\u2019s nurse;\nLost without thee the ennobling powers of verse;\nHeroic song from thy free touch acquires\nIts clearest tone, the rapture it inspires.\n\nPlace me where Winter breathes his keenest air,\nAnd I will sing, if Liberty be there;\nAnd I will sing at Liberty\u2019s dear feet,\nIn Afric\u2019s torrid clime, or India\u2019s fiercest heat.\n\nA.\n\nSing where you please; in such a cause I grant\nAn English poet\u2019s privilege to rant;\nBut is not freedom\u2014at least, is not ours\nToo apt to play the wanton with her powers,\nGrow freakish, and o\u2019erleaping every mound,\nSpread anarchy and terror all around?\n\nB.\n\nAgreed.\n\nBut would you sell or slay your horse\nFor bounding and curveting in his course?\n\nOr if, when ridden with a careless rein,\nHe break away, and seek the distant plain?\n\nNo.\n\nHis high mettle, under good control,\nGives him Olympic speed, and shoots him to the goal.\n\nLet Discipline employ her wholesome arts;\nLet magistrates alert perform their parts,\nNot skulk or put on a prudential mask,\nAs if their duty were a desperate task;\nLet active laws apply the needful curb,\nTo guard the peace that riot would disturb;\nAnd Liberty, preserved from wild excess,\nShall raise no feuds for armies to suppress.\n\nWhen Tumult lately burst his prison-door,\nAnd set plebeian thousands in a roar;\nWhen he usurp\u2019d authority\u2019s just place,\nAnd dared to look his master in the face;\nWhen the rude rabble\u2019s watchword was\u2014Destroy,\nAnd blazing London seem\u2019d a second Troy;\nLiberty blush\u2019d, and hung her drooping head,\nBeheld their progress with the deepest dread;\nBlush\u2019d that effects like these she should produce,\nWorse than the deeds of galley-slaves broke loose.\n\nShe loses in such storms her very name,\nAnd fierce licentiousness should bear the blame.\n\nIncomparable gem! thy worth untold:\nCheap, though blood-bought, and thrown away when sold;\nMay no foes ravish thee, and no false friend\nBetray thee, while professing to defend!\nPrize it, ye ministers; ye monarchs, spare;\nYe patriots, guard it with a miser\u2019s care.\n\nA.\n\nPatriots, alas! the few that have been found,\nWhere most they\u00a0 flourish, upon English ground,\nThe country\u2019s need have scantily supplied,\nAnd the last left the scene when Chatham died.\n\nB.\n\nNot so\u2014the virtue still adorns our age,\nThough the chief actor died upon the stage.\n\nIn him Demosthenes was heard again;\nLiberty taught him her Athenian strain;\nShe clothed him with authority and awe,\nSpoke from his lips, and in his looks gave law.\n\nHis speech, his form, his action, full of grace,\nAnd all his country beaming in his face,\nHe stood, as some inimitable hand\nWould strive to make a Paul or Tully stand.\n\nNo sycophant or slave, that dared oppose\nHer sacred cause, but trembled when he rose;\nAnd every venal stickler for the yoke\nFelt himself crush\u2019d at the first word he spoke.\n\nSuch men are raised to station and command,\nWhen Providence means mercy to a land.\n\nHe speaks, and they appear; to him they owe\nSkill to direct, and strength to strike the blow;\nTo manage with address, to seize with power\nThe crisis of a dark decisive hour.\n\nSo Gideon earn\u2019d a victory not his own;\nSubserviency his praise, and that alone.\n\nPoor England! thou art a devoted deer,\nBeset with every ill but that of fear.\n\nThe nations hunt; all mark thee for a prey;\nThey swarm around thee, and thou stand\u2019st at bay:\nUndaunted still, though wearied and perplex\u2019d,\nOnce Chatham saved thee; but who saves thee next?\n\nAlas! the tide of pleasure sweeps along\nAll that should be the boast of British song.\n\n\u2018Tis not the wreath that once adorn\u2019d thy brow,\nThe prize of happier times, will serve thee now.\n\nOur ancestry, a gallant Christian race,\nPatterns of every virtue, every grace,\nConfess\u2019d a God; they kneel\u2019d before they fought,\nAnd praised him in the victories he wrought.\n\nNow from the dust of ancient days bring forth\nTheir sober zeal, integrity, and worth;\nCourage, ungraced by these, affronts the skies,\nIs but the fire without the sacrifice.\n\nThe stream that feeds the wellspring of the heart\nNot more invigorates life\u2019s noblest part,\nThan virtue quickens with a warmth divine\nThe powers that sin has brought to a decline.\n\nA.\n\nThe inestimable estimate of Brown\nRose like a paper-kite, and charm\u2019d the town;\nBut measures, plann\u2019d and executed well,\nShifted the wind that raised it, and it fell.\n\nHe trod the very selfsame ground you tread,\nAnd victory refuted all he said.\n\nB.\n\nAnd yet his judgment was not framed amiss;\nIts error, if it err\u2019d, was merely this\u2014\nHe thought the dying hour already come,\nAnd a complete recovery struck him dumb.\n\nBut that effeminacy, folly, lust,\nEnervate and enfeeble, and needs must;\nAnd that a nation shamefully debased\nWill be despised and trampled on at last,\nUnless sweet penitence her powers renew,\nIs truth, if history itself be true.\n\nThere is a time, and justice marks the date,\nFor long forbearing clemency to wait;\nThat hour elapsed, the incurable revolt\nIs punish\u2019d, and down comes the thunderbolt.\n\nIf Mercy then put by the threatening blow,\nMust she perform the same kind office now?\n\nMay she! and if offended Heaven be still\nAccessible, and prayer prevail, she will.\n\n\u2018Tis not, however, insolence and noise,\nThe tempest of tumultuary joys,\nNor is it yet despondence and dismay\nWill win her visits or engage her stay;\nPrayer only, and the penitential tear,\nCan call her smiling down, and fix her here.\n\nBut when a country (one that I could name)\nIn prostitution sinks the sense of shame;\nWhen infamous venality, grown bold,\nWrites on his bosom, To be let or sold;\nWhen perjury, that Heaven-defying vice,\nSells oaths by tale, and at the lowest price,\nStamps God\u2019s own name upon a lie just made,\nTo turn a penny in the way of trade;\nWhen avarice starves (and never hides his face)\nTwo or three millions of the human race,\nAnd not a tongue inquires how, where, or when,\nThough conscience will have twinges now and then\nWhen profanation of the sacred cause\nIn all its parts, times, ministry, and laws,\nBespeaks a land, once Christian, fallen and lost,\nIn all that wars against that title most;\nWhat follows next let cities of great name,\nAnd regions long since desolate proclaim.\n\nNineveh, Babylon, and ancient Rome,\nSpeak to the present times and times to come;\nThey cry aloud in every careless ear,\nStop, while ye may; suspend your mad career;\nO learn, from our example and our fate,\nLearn wisdom and repentance ere too late!\nNot only Vice disposes and prepares\nThe mind that slumbers sweetly in her snares,\nTo stoop to tyranny\u2019s usurp\u2019d command,\nAnd bend her polish\u2019d neck beneath his hand\n(A dire effect by one of Nature\u2019s laws\nUnchangeably connected with its cause);\nBut Providence himself will intervene,\nTo throw his dark displeasure o\u2019er the scene.\n\nAll are his instruments; each form of war,\nWhat burns at home, or threatens from afar,\nNature in arms, her elements at strife,\nThe storms that overset the joys of life,\nAre but his rods to scourge a guilty land,\nAnd waste it at the bidding of his hand.\n\nHe gives the word, and mutiny soon roars\nIn all her gates, and shakes her distant shores;\nThe standards of all nations are unfurl\u2019d;\nShe has one foe, and that one foe the world.\n\nAnd if he doom that people with a frown,\nAnd mark them with a seal of wrath press\u2019d down,\nObduracy takes place; callous and tough,\nThe reprobated race grows judgment-proof:\nEarth shakes beneath them, and Heaven roars above,\nBut nothing scares them from the course they love.\n\nTo the lascivious pipe and wanton song,\nThat charm down fear, they frolic it along,\nWith mad rapidity and unconcern,\nDown to the gulf from which is no return.\n\nThey trust in navies, and their navies fail\u2014\nGod\u2019s curse can cast away ten thousand sail!\nThey trust in armies, and their courage dies;\nIn wisdom, wealth, in fortune, and in lies;\nBut all they trust in withers, as it must,\nWhen He commands in whom they place no trust.\n\nVengeance at last pours down upon their coast\nA long despised, but now victorious, host;\nTyranny sends the chain that must abridge\nThe noble sweep of all their privilege;\nGives liberty the last, the mortal, shock;\nSlips the slave\u2019s collar on, and snaps the lock.\n\nA.\n\nSuch lofty strains embellish what you teach,\nMean you to prophesy, or but to preach?\n\nB.\n\nI know the mind that feels indeed the fire\nThe Muse imparts, and can command the lyre,\nActs with a force, and kindles with a zeal,\nWhate\u2019er the theme, that others never feel.\n\nIf human woes her soft attention claim,\nA tender sympathy pervades the frame,\nShe pours a sensibility divine\nAlong the nerve of every feeling line.\n\nBut if a deed not tamely to be borne\nFire indignation and a sense of scorn,\nThe strings are swept with such a power, so loud,\nThe storm of music shakes the astonish\u2019d crowd.\n\nSo, when remote futurity is brought\nBefore the keen inquiry of her thought,\nA terrible sagacity informs\nThe poet\u2019s heart; he looks to distant storms;\nHe hears the thunder ere the tempest lowers!\nAnd, arm\u2019d with strength surpassing human powers,\nSeizes events as yet unknown to man,\nAnd darts his soul into the dawning plan\nHence, in a Roman mouth, the graceful name\nOf prophet and of poet was the same;\nHence British poets too the priesthood shared,\nAnd every hallow\u2019d druid was a bard.\n\nBut no prophetic fires to me belong;\nI play with syllables, and sport in song.\n\nA.\n\nAt Westminster, where little poets strive\nTo set a distich upon six and five,\nWhere Discipline helps opening buds of sense\nAnd makes his pupils proud with silver pence,\nI was a poet too; but modern taste\nIs so refined, and delicate, and chaste,\nThat verse, whatever fire the fancy warms,\nWithout a creamy smoothness has no charms.\n\nThus all success depending on an ear,\nAnd thinking I might purchase it too dear,\nIf sentiment were sacrificed to sound,\nAnd truth cut short to make a period round,\nI judged a man of sense could scarce do worse\nThan caper in the morris-dance of verse.\n\nB.\n\nThus reputation is a spur to wit,\nAnd some wits flag through fear of losing it.\n\nGive me the line that ploughs its stately course,\nLike a proud swan, conquering the stream by force;\nThat, like some cottage beauty, strikes the heart,\nQuite unindebted to the tricks of art.\n\nWhen labour and when dulness, club in hand,\nLike the two figures at St.\n\nDunstan\u2019s stand,\nBeating alternately, in measured time,\nThe clockwork tintinnabulum of rhyme,\nExact and regular the sounds will be;\nBut such mere quarter-strokes are not for me.\n\nFrom him who rears a poem lank and long,\nTo him who strains his all into a song;\nPerhaps some bonny Caledonian air,\nAll birks and braes, though he was never there;\nOr, having whelp\u2019d a prologue with great pains,\nFeels himself spent, and fumbles for his brains;\nA prologue interdash\u2019d with many a stroke\u2014\nAn art contrived to advertise a joke,\nSo that the jest is clearly to be seen,\nNot in the words\u2014but in the gap between;\nManner is all in all, whate\u2019er is writ,\nThe substitute for genius, sense, and wit.\n\nTo dally much with subject mean and low\nProves that the mind is weak, or makes it so.\n\nNeglected talents rust into decay,\nAnd every effort ends in pushpin play.\n\nThe man that means success should soar above\nA soldier\u2019s feather, or a lady\u2019s glove;\nElse, summoning the muse to such a theme,\nThe fruit of all her labour is whipp\u2019d cream.\n\nAs if an eagle flew aloft, and then\u2014\nStoop\u2019d from its highest pitch to pounce a wren.\n\nAs if the poet, purposing to wed,\nShould carve himself a wife in gingerbread.\n\nAges elapsed ere Homer\u2019s lamp appear\u2019d,\nAnd ages ere the Mantuan swan was heard;\nTo carry nature lengths unknown before,\nTo give a Milton birth, ask\u2019d ages more.\n\nThus genius rose and set at order\u2019d times,\nAnd shot a day-spring into distant climes,\nEnnobling every region that he chose;\nHe sunk in Greece, in Italy he rose;\nAnd, tedious years of Gothic darkness pass\u2019d,\nEmerged all splendour in our isle at last.\n\nThus lovely halcyons dive into the main,\nThen shew far off their shining plumes again.\n\nA.\n\nIs genius only found in epic lays?\n\nProve this, and forfeit all pretence to praise.\n\nMake their heroic powers your own at once,\nOr candidly confess yourself a dunce.\n\nB.\n\nThese were the chief; each interval of night\nWas graced with many an undulating light\nIn less illustrious bards his beauty shone\nA meteor, or a star; in these, the sun.\n\nThe nightingale may claim the topmost bough,\nWhile the poor grasshopper must chirp below.\n\nLike him unnoticed, I, and such as I,\nSpread little wings, and rather skip than fly;\nPerch\u2019d on the meagre produce of the land,\nAn ell or two of prospect we command;\nBut never peep beyond the thorny bound,\nOr oaken fence, that hems the paddock round.\n\nIn Eden, ere yet innocence of heart\nHad faded, poetry was not an art;\nLanguage, above all teaching, or if taught,\nOnly by gratitude and glowing thought,\nElegant as simplicity, and warm\nAs ecstacy, unmanacled by form,\nNot prompted, as in our degenerate days,\nBy low ambition and the thirst of praise,\nWas natural as is the flowing stream,\nAnd yet magnificent\u2014a God the theme!\nThat theme on earth exhausted, though above\n\u2018Tis found as everlasting as his love,\nMan lavish\u2019d all his thoughts on human things\u2014\nThe feats of heroes and the wrath of kings;\nBut still, while virtue kindled his delight,\nThe song was moral, and so far was right.\n\n\u2018Twas thus till luxury seduced the mind\nTo joys less innocent, as less refined;\nThen Genius danced a bacchanal; he crown\u2019d\nThe brimming goblet, seized the thyrsus, bound\nHis brows with ivy, rush\u2019d into the field\nOf wild imagination, and there reel\u2019d,\nThe victim of his own lascivious fires,\nAnd, dizzy with delight, profaned the sacred wires:\nAnacreon, Horace, play\u2019d in Greece and Rome\nThis bedlam part; and others nearer home.\n\nWhen Cromwell fought for power, and while he reign\u2019d\nThe proud protector of the power he gain\u2019d,\nReligion, harsh, intolerant, austere,\nParent of manners like herself severe,\nDrew a rough copy of the Christian face,\nWithout the smile, the sweetness, or the grace;\nThe dark and sullen humour of the time\nJudged every effort of the muse a crime;\nVerse, in the finest mould of fancy cast,\nWas lumber in an age so void of taste\nBut when the second Charles assumed the sway,\nAnd arts revived beneath a softer day,\nThen, like a bow long forced into a curve,\nThe mind, released from too constrain\u2019d a nerve,\nFlew to its first position with a spring,\nThat made the vaulted roofs of pleasure ring.\n\nHis court, the dissolute and hateful school\nOf wantonness, where vice was taught by rule,\nSwarm\u2019d with a scribbling herd, as deep inlaid\nWith brutal lust as ever Circe made.\n\nFrom these a long succession, in the rage\nOf rank obscenity, debauch\u2019d their age:\nNor ceased till, ever anxious to redress\nThe abuses of her sacred charge, the press,\nThe Muse instructed a well-nurtured train\nOf abler votaries to cleanse the stain,\nAnd claim the palm for purity of song,\nThat lewdness had usurp\u2019d and worn so long.\n\nThen decent pleasantry and sterling sense,\nThat neither gave nor would endure offence,\nWhipp\u2019d out of sight, with satire just and keen,\nThe puppy pack that had defiled the scene.\n\nIn front of these came Addison.\n\nIn him\nHumour in holiday and sightly trim,\nSublimity and Attic taste combined,\nTo polish, furnish, and delight the mind.\n\nThen Pope, as harmony itself exact,\nIn verse well-disciplined, complete, compact,\nGave virtue and morality a grace,\nThat, quite eclipsing pleasure\u2019s painted face,\nLevied a tax of wonder and applause,\nE\u2019en on the fools that trampled on their laws.\n\nBut he (his musical finesse was such,\nSo nice his ear, so delicate his touch)\nMade poetry a mere mechanic art;\nAnd every warbler has his tune by heart.\n\nNature imparting her satiric gift,\nHer serious mirth, to Arbuthnot and Swift,\nWith droll sobriety they raised a smile\nAt folly\u2019s cost, themselves unmoved the while.\n\nThat constellation set, the world in vain\nMust hope to look upon their like again.\n\nA.\n\nAre we then left?\n\n\u2014B.\n\nNot wholly in the dark;\nWit now and then, struck smartly, shews a spark,\nSufficient to redeem the modern race\nFrom total night and absolute disgrace.\n\nWhile servile trick and imitative knack\nConfine the million in the beaten track,\nPerhaps some courser, who disdains the road,\nSnuffs up the wind, and flings himself abroad.\n\nContemporaries all surpass\u2019d, see one;\nShort his career indeed, but ably run;\nChurchill, himself unconscious of his powers,\nIn penury consumed his idle hours;\nAnd, like a scatter\u2019d seed at random sown,\nWas left to spring by vigour of his own.\n\nLifted at length, by dignity of thought\nAnd dint of genius, to an affluent lot,\nHe laid his head in luxury\u2019s soft lap,\nAnd took, too often, there his easy nap.\n\nIf brighter beams than all he threw not forth,\n\u2018Twas negligence in him, not want of worth.\n\nSurly and slovenly, and bold and coarse,\nToo proud for art, and trusting in mere force,\nSpendthrift alike of money and of wit,\nAlways at speed, and never drawing bit,\nHe struck the lyre in such a careless mood,\nAnd so disdain\u2019d the rules he understood,\nThe laurel seem\u2019d to wait on his command;\nHe snatch\u2019d it rudely from the muses\u2019 hand.\n\nNature, exerting an unwearied power,\nForms, opens, and gives scent to every flower;\nSpreads the fresh verdure of the field, and leads\nThe dancing Naiads through the dewy meads;\nShe fills profuse ten thousand little throats\nWith music, modulating all their notes;\nAnd charms the woodland scenes and wilds unknown,\nWith artless airs and concerts of her own;\nBut seldom (as if fearful of expense)\nVouchsafes to man a poet\u2019s just pretence\u2014\nFervency, freedom, fluency of thought,\nHarmony, strength, words exquisitely sought;\nFancy, that from the bow that spans the sky\nBrings colours, dipp\u2019d in heaven, that never die;\nA soul exalted above earth, a mind\nSkill\u2019d in the characters that form mankind;\nAnd, as the sun, in rising beauty dress\u2019d,\nLooks to the westward from the dappled east,\nAnd marks, whatever clouds may interpose,\nEre yet his race begins, its glorious close;\nAn eye like his to catch the distant goal;\nOr, ere the wheels of verse begin to roll,\nLike his to shed illuminating rays\nOn every scene and subject it surveys;\nThus graced, the man asserts a poet\u2019s name,\nAnd the world cheerfully admits the claim.\n\nPity Religion has so seldom found\nA skilful guide into poetic ground!\nThe flowers would spring where\u2019er she deign\u2019d to stray,\nAnd every muse attend her in her way.\n\nVirtue indeed meets many a rhyming friend,\nAnd many a compliment politely penn\u2019d;\nBut, unattired in that becoming vest\nReligion weaves for her, and half undress\u2019d,\nStands in the desert shivering and forlorn,\nA wintry figure, like a wither\u2019d thorn.\n\nThe shelves are full, all other themes are sped;\nHackney\u2019d and worn to the last flimsy thread,\nSatire has long since done his best; and curst\nAnd loathsome ribaldry has done his worst;\nFancy has sported all her powers away\nIn tales, in trifles, and in children\u2019s play;\nAnd \u2018tis the sad complaint, and almost true,\nWhate\u2019er we write, we bring forth nothing new.\n\n\u2018Twere new indeed to see a bard all fire,\nTouch\u2019d with a coal from heaven, assume the lyre.\n\nAnd tell the world, still kindling as he sung,\nWith more than mortal music on his tongue,\nThat He, who died below, and reigns above,\nInspires the song, and that his name is Love.\n\nFor, after all, if merely to beguile,\nBy flowing numbers and a flowery style,\nThe tedium that the lazy rich endure,\nWhich now and then sweet poetry may cure;\nOr, if to see the name of idol self,\nStamp\u2019d on the well-bound quarto, grace the shelf,\nTo float a bubble on the breath of fame,\nPrompt his endeavour and engage his aim,\nDebased to servile purposes of pride,\nHow are the powers of genius misapplied!\nThe gift, whose office is the Giver\u2019s praise,\nTo trace him in his word, his works, his ways!\nThen spread the rich discovery, and invite\nMankind to share in the divine delight:\nDistorted from its use and just design,\nTo make the pitiful possessor shine,\nTo purchase at the fool-frequented fair\nOf vanity a wreath for self to wear,\nIs profanation of the basest kind\u2014\nProof of a trifling and a worthless mind.\n\nA.\n\nHail, Sternhold, then! and, Hopkins, hail!\u2014\nB.\n\nAmen.\n\nIf flattery, folly, lust, employ the pen;\nIf acrimony, slander, and abuse,\nGive it a charge to blacken and traduce;\nThough Butler\u2019s wit, Pope\u2019s numbers, Prior\u2019s ease,\nWith all that fancy can invent to please,\nAdorn the polish\u2019d periods as they fall,\nOne madrigal of theirs is worth them all.\n\nA.\n\n\u2018Twould thin the ranks of the poetic tribe,\nTo dash the pen through all that you proscribe.\n\nB.\n\nNo matter\u2014we could shift

a stately speech;\nSuch as grave Livers do in Scotland use,\nReligious men, who give to God and man their dues.\n\nHe told, that to these waters he had come\nTo gather leeches, being old and poor:\nEmployment hazardous and wearisome!\nAnd he had many hardships to endure:\nFrom pond to pond he roamed, from moor to moor;\nHousing, with God's good help, by choice or chance;\nAnd in this way he gained an honest maintenance.\n\nThe old Man still stood talking by my side;\nBut now his voice to me was like a stream\nScarce heard;

stirring thus about his feet\nThe waters of the pools where they abide.\n\n\"Once I could meet with them on every side;\nBut they have dwindled long by slow decay;\nYet still I persevere, and find them where I may.\n\n\nWhile he was talking thus, the lonely place,\nThe old Man's shape, and speech\u2014all troubled me:\nIn my mind's eye I seemed to see him pace\nAbout the weary moors continually,\nWandering about alone and silently.\n\nWhile I these thoughts within myself pursued,\nHe, having made a pause, the same discourse renewed.\n\nAnd soon with this he other matter blended,\nCheerfully uttered, with demeanour kind,\nBut stately in the main; and, when he ended,\nI could have laughed myself to scorn to find\nIn that decrepit Man so firm a mind.\n\n\"God,\" said I, \"be my help and stay secure;\nI'll think of the Leech-gatherer on the lonely moor!\"\n", "period": "Romantic", "literary_movement": "Romanticism", "register": "Reflective", "rhetorical_genre": "Epideictic", "discursive_structure": "Descriptive", "discourse_type": "Expository", "narrative_level": "Extradiegetic", "diegetic_mimetic": "Mimetic", "focalization": "Third person omniscient", "person": NaN, "deictic_orientation": "Extralocative", "addressee_type": "General", "deictic_object": NaN, "temporal_orientation": "Past", "temporal_structure": "Linear", "tradition": "British Romanticism", "mode": "Lyric", "genre": "Narrative Poem", "stanza_structure": "Quatrains", "meter": "Iambic pentameter", "rhyme": "AABB"}

what the adventurer's age\nHath now escaped his memory--but the hour,\nOne of a golden summer holiday,\nHe well remembers, though the year be gone--\nAlone and devious from afar he came;\nAnd, with a sudden influx overpowered\nAt sight of this seclusion, he forgot\nHis haste, for hasty had his footsteps been\nAs boyish his pursuits; and sighing said,\n\"What happy fortune were it here to live!\nAnd, if a thought of dying, if a thought\nOf mortal separation, could intrude\nWith paradise before him, here to die!\"\nNo Prophet was he, had not even a hope,\nScarcely a wish, but one bright pleasing thought,\nA fancy in the heart of what might be\nThe lot of others, never could be his.\n\nThe station whence he looked was soft and green,\nNot giddy yet aerial, with a depth\nOf vale below, a height of hills above.\n\nFor rest of body perfect was the spot,\nAll that luxurious nature could desire;\nBut stirring to the spirit; who could gaze\nAnd not feel motions there?\n\nHe thought of clouds\nThat sail on winds: of breezes that delight\nTo play on water, or in endless chase\nPursue each other through the yielding plain\nOf grass or corn, over and through and through,\nIn billow after billow, evermore\nDisporting--nor unmindful was the boy\nOf sunbeams, shadows, butterflies and birds;\nOf fluttering sylphs and softly-gliding Fays,\nGenii, and winged angels that are Lords\nWithout restraint of all which they behold.\n\nThe illusion strengthening as he gazed, he felt\nThat such unfettered liberty was his,\nSuch power and joy; but only for this end,\nTo flit from field to rock, from rock to field,\nFrom shore to island, and from isle to shore,\nFrom open ground to covert, from a bed\nOf meadow-flowers into a tuft of wood;\nFrom high to low, from low to high, yet still\nWithin the bound of this huge concave; here\nMust be his home, this valley be his world.\n\nSince that day forth the Place to him--'to me'\n(For I who live to register the truth\nWas that same young and happy Being) became\nAs beautiful to thought, as it had been\nWhen present, to the bodily sense; a haunt\nOf pure affections, shedding upon joy\nA brighter joy; and through such damp and gloom\nOf the gay mind, as ofttimes splenetic youth\nMistakes for sorrow, darting beams of light\nThat no self-cherished sadness could withstand;\nAnd now 'tis mine, perchance for life, dear Vale,\nBeloved Grasmere (let the wandering streams\nTake up, the cloud-capt hills repeat, the Name)\nOne of thy lowly Dwellings is my Home.\n\nAnd was the cost so great?\n\nand could it seem\nAn act of courage, and the thing itself\nA conquest?\n\nwho must bear the blame?\n\nSage man\nThy prudence, thy experience, thy desires,\nThy apprehensions--blush thou for them all.\n\nYes the realities of life so cold,\nSo cowardly, so ready to betray,\nSo stinted in the measure of their grace\nAs we pronounce them, doing them much wrong,\nHave been to me more bountiful than hope,\nLess timid than desire--but that is past.\n\nOn Nature's invitation do I come,\nBy Reason sanctioned.\n\nCan the choice mislead,\nThat made the calmest fairest spot of earth\nWith all its unappropriated good\nMy own; and not mine only, for with me\nEntrenched, say rather peacefully embowered,\nUnder yon orchard, in yon humble cot,\nA younger Orphan of a home extinct,\nThe only Daughter of my Parents dwells.\n\nAy, think on that, my heart, and cease to stir,\nPause upon that and let the breathing frame\nNo longer breathe, but all be satisfied.\n\n--Oh, if such silence be not thanks to God\nFor what hath been bestowed, then where, where then\nShall gratitude find rest?\n\nMine eyes did ne'er\nFix on a lovely object, nor my mind\nTake pleasure in the midst of happy thoughts,\nBut either She whom now I have, who now\nDivides with me this loved abode, was there,\nOr not far off.\n\nWhere'er my footsteps turned,\nHer voice was like a hidden Bird that sang,\nThe thought of her was like a flash of light,\nOr an unseen companionship, a breath\nOf fragrance independent of the Wind.\n\nIn all my goings, in the new and old\nOf all my meditations, and in this\nFavourite of all, in this the most of all.\n\n--What being, therefore, since the birth of Man\nHad ever more abundant cause to speak\nThanks, and if favours of the Heavenly Muse\nMake him more thankful, then to call on Verse\nTo aid him and in song resound his joy?\n\nThe boon is absolute; surpassing grace\nTo me hath been vouchsafed; among the bowers\nOf blissful Eden this was neither given\nNor could be given, possession of the good\nWhich had been sighed for, ancient thought fulfilled,\nAnd dear Imaginations realised,\nUp to their highest measure, yea and more.\n\nEmbrace me then, ye Hills, and close me in;\nNow in the clear and open day I feel\nYour guardianship; I take it to my heart;\n'Tis like the solemn shelter of the night.\n\nBut I would call thee beautiful, for mild,\nAnd soft, and gay, and beautiful thou art\nDear Valley, having in thy face a smile\nThough peaceful, full of gladness.\n\nThou art pleased,\nPleased with thy crags and woody steeps, thy Lake,\nIts one green island and its winding shores;\nThe multitude of little rocky hills,\nThy Church and cottages of mountain stone\nClustered like stars some few, but single most,\nAnd lurking dimly in their shy retreats,\nOr glancing at each other cheerful looks\nLike separated stars with clouds between.\n\nWhat want we?\n\nhave we not perpetual streams,\nWarm woods, and sunny hills, and fresh green fields,\nAnd mountains not less green, and flocks and herds,\nAnd thickets full of songsters, and the voice\nOf lordly birds, an unexpected sound\nHeard now and then from morn to latest eve,\nAdmonishing the man who walks below\nOf solitude and silence in the sky?\n\nThese have we, and a thousand nooks of earth\nHave also these, but nowhere else is found,\nNowhere (or is it fancy?\n\n) can be found\nThe one sensation that is here; 'tis here,\nHere as it found its way into my heart\nIn childhood, here as it abides by day,\nBy night, here only; or in chosen minds\nThat take it with them hence, where'er they go.\n\n--'Tis, but I cannot name it, 'tis the sense\nOf majesty, and beauty, and repose,\nA blended holiness of earth and sky,\nSomething that makes this individual spot,\nThis small abiding-place of many men,\nA termination, and a last retreat,\nA centre, come from wheresoe'er you will,\nA whole without dependence or defect,\nMade for itself, and happy in itself,\nPerfect contentment, Unity entire.\n\nBleak season was it, turbulent and bleak,\nWhen hitherward we journeyed side by side\nThrough burst of sunshine and through flying showers;\nPaced the long vales--how long they were--and yet\nHow fast that length of way was left behind,\nWensley's rich Vale, and Sedbergh's naked heights.\n\nThe frosty wind, as if to make amends\nFor its keen breath, was aiding to our steps,\nAnd drove us onward like two ships at sea,\nOr like two birds, companions in mid-air,\nParted and reunited by the blast.\n\nStern was the face of nature; we rejoiced\nIn that stern countenance, for our souls thence drew\nA feeling of their strength.\n\nThe naked trees,\nThe icy brooks, as on we passed, appeared\nTo question us.\n\n\"Whence come ye, to what end?\n\nThey seemed to say, \"What would ye,\" said the shower,\n\"Wild Wanderers, whither through my dark domain?\n\nThe sunbeam said, \"Be happy.\n\n\" When this vale\nWe entered, bright and solemn was the sky\nThat faced us with a passionate welcoming,\nAnd led us to our threshold.\n\nDaylight failed\nInsensibly, and round us gently fell\nComposing darkness, with a quiet load\nOf full contentment, in a little shed\nDisturbed, uneasy in itself as seemed,\nAnd wondering at its new inhabitants.\n\nIt loves us now, this Vale so beautiful\nBegins to love us! by a sullen storm,\nTwo months unwearied of severest storm,\nIt put the temper of our minds to proof,\nAnd found us faithful through the gloom, and heard\nThe poet mutter his prelusive songs\nWith cheerful heart, an unknown voice of joy\nAmong the silence of the woods and hills;\nSilent to any gladsomeness of sound\nWith all their shepherds.\n\nBut the gates of Spring\nAre opened; churlish winter hath given leave\nThat she should entertain for this one day,\nPerhaps for many genial days to come,\nHis guests, and make them jocund.\n\n--They are pleased,\nBut most of all the birds that haunt the flood\nWith the mild summons; inmates though they be\nOf Winter's household, they keep festival\nThis day, who drooped, or seemed to droop, so long;\nThey show their pleasure, and shall I do less?\n\nHappier of happy though I be, like them\nI cannot take possession of the sky,\nMount with a thoughtless impulse, and wheel there\nOne of a mighty multitude, whose way\nIs a perpetual harmony and dance\nMagnificent.\n\nBehold how with a grace\nOf ceaseless motion, that might scarcely seem\nInferior to angelical, they prolong\nTheir curious pastime, shaping in mid-air,\nAnd sometimes with ambitious wing that soars\nHigh as the level of the mountain tops,\nA circuit ampler than the lake beneath,\nTheir own domain;--but ever, while intent\nOn tracing and retracing that large round,\nTheir jubilant activity evolves\nHundreds of curves and circlets, to and fro,\nUpwards and downwards; progress intricate\nYet unperplexed, as if one spirit swayed\nTheir indefatigable flight.\n\n'Tis done,\nTen times and more I fancied it had ceased,\nBut lo! the vanished company again\nAscending, they approach.\n\nI hear their wings\nFaint, faint at first; and then an eager sound\nPassed in a moment--and as faint again!\nThey tempt the sun to sport among their plumes;\nTempt the smooth water, or the gleaming ice,\nTo show them a fair image,--'tis themselves,\nTheir own fair forms upon the glimmering plain\nPainted more soft and fair as they descend,\nAlmost to touch,--then up again aloft,\nUp with a sally and a flash of speed,\nAs if they scorned both resting-place and rest!\n--This day is a thanksgiving, 'tis a day\nOf glad emotion and deep quietness;\nNot upon me alone hath been bestowed,\nMe rich in many onward-looking thoughts,\nThe penetrating bliss; oh surely these\nHave felt it, not the happy choirs of spring,\nHer own peculiar family of love\nThat sport among green leaves, a blither train!\nBut two are missing, two, a lonely pair\nOf milk-white Swans; wherefore are they not seen\nPartaking this day's pleasure?\n\nFrom afar\nThey came, to sojourn here in solitude,\nChoosing this Valley, they who had the choice\nOf the whole world.\n\nWe saw them day by day,\nThrough those two months of unrelenting storm,\nConspicuous at the centre of the Lake\nTheir safe retreat, we knew them well, I guess\nThat the whole valley knew them; but to us\nThey were more dear than may be well believed,\nNot only for their beauty, and their still\nAnd placid way of life, and constant love\nInseparable, not for these alone,\nBut that 'their' state so much resembled ours,\nThey having also chosen this abode;\nThey strangers, and we strangers, they a pair,\nAnd we a solitary pair like them.\n\nThey should not have departed; many days\nDid I look forth in vain, nor on the wing\nCould see them, nor in that small open space\nOf blue unfrozen water, where they lodged\nAnd lived so long in quiet, side by side.\n\nShall we behold them consecrated friends,\nFaithful companions, yet another year\nSurviving, they for us, and we for them,\nAnd neither pair be broken?\n\nnay perchance\nIt is too late already for such hope;\nThe Dalesmen may have aimed the deadly tube,\nAnd parted them; or haply both are gone\nOne death, and that were mercy given to both.\n\nRecall, my song, the ungenerous thought; forgive,\nThrice favoured Region, the conjecture harsh\nOf such inhospitable penalty\nInflicted upon confidence so pure.\n\nAh! if I wished to follow where the sight\nOf all that is before my eyes, the voice\nWhich speaks from a presiding spirit here,\nWould lead me, I should whisper to myself:\nThey who are dwellers in this holy place\nMust needs themselves be hallowed, they require\nNo benediction from the stranger's lips,\nFor they are blessed already; none would give\nThe greeting \"peace be with you\" unto them,\nFor peace they have; it cannot but be theirs,\nAnd mercy, and forbearance--nay--not these--\n'Their' healing offices a pure good-will\nPrecludes, and charity beyond the bounds\nOf charity--an overflowing love;\nNot for the creature only, but for all\nThat is around them; love for everything\nWhich in their happy Region they behold!\nThus do we soothe ourselves, and when the thought\nIs passed, we blame it not for having come.\n\n--What if I floated down a pleasant stream,\nAnd now am landed, and the motion gone,\nShall I reprove myself?\n\nAh no, the stream\nIs flowing, and will never cease to flow,\nAnd I shall float upon that stream again.\n\nBy such forgetfulness the soul becomes,\nWords cannot say how beautiful: then hail,\nHail to the visible Presence, hail to thee,\nDelightful Valley, habitation fair!\nAnd to whatever else of outward form\nCan give an inward help, can purify,\nAnd elevate, and harmonise, and soothe,\nAnd steal away, and for a while deceive\nAnd lap in pleasing rest, and bear us on\nWithout desire in full complacency,\nContemplating perfection absolute,\nAnd entertained as in a placid sleep.\n\nBut not betrayed by tenderness of mind\nThat feared, or wholly overlooked the truth,\nDid we come hither, with romantic hope\nTo find in midst of so much loveliness\nLove, perfect love: of so much majesty\nA like majestic-frame of mind in those\nWho here abide, the persons like the place.\n\nNot from such hope, or aught of such belief,\nHath issued any portion of the joy\nWhich I have felt this day.\n\nAn awful voice\n'Tis true hath in my walks been often heard,\nSent from the mountains or the sheltered fields,\nShout after shout--reiterated whoop,\nIn manner of a bird that takes delight\nIn answering to itself: or like a hound\nSingle at chase among the lonely woods,\nHis yell repeating; yet it was in truth\nA human voice--a spirit of coming night;\nHow solemn when the sky is dark, and earth\nNot dark, nor yet enlightened, but by snow\nMade visible, amid a noise of winds\nAnd bleatings manifold of mountain sheep,\nWhich in that iteration recognise\nTheir summons, and are gathering round for food,\nDevoured with keenness, ere to grove or bank\nOr rocky bield with patience they retire.\n\nThat very voice, which, in some timid mood\nOf superstitious fancy, might have seemed\nAwful as ever stray demoniac uttered,\nHis steps to govern in the wilderness;\nOr as the Norman Curfew's regular beat\nTo hearths when first they darkened at the knell:\nThat shepherd's voice, it may have reached mine ear\nDebased and under profanation, made\nThe ready organ of articulate sounds\nFrom ribaldry, impiety, or wrath,\nIssuing when shame hath ceased to check the brawls\nOf some abused Festivity--so be it.\n\nI came not dreaming of unruffled life,\nUntainted manners; born among the hills,\nBred also there, I wanted not a scale\nTo regulate my hopes; pleased with the good\nI shrink not from the evil with disgust,\nOr with immoderate pain.\n\nI look for Man,\nThe common creature of the brotherhood,\nDiffering but little from the Man elsewhere,\nFor selfishness and envy and revenge,\nIll neighbourhood--pity that this should be--\nFlattery and double-dealing, strife and wrong.\n\nYet is it something gained, it is in truth\nA mighty gain, that Labour here preserves\nHis rosy face, a servant only here\nOf the fireside or of the open field,\nA Freeman therefore sound and unimpaired:\nThat extreme penury is here unknown,\nAnd cold and hunger's abject wretchedness\nMortal to body and the heaven-born mind:\nThat they who want are not too great a weight\nFor those who can relieve; here may the heart\nBreathe in the air of fellow-suffering\nDreadless, as in a kind of fresher breeze\nOf her own native element, the hand\nBe ready and unwearied without plea,\nFrom tasks too frequent or beyond its power,\nFor languor or indifference or despair.\n\nAnd as these lofty barriers break the force\nOf winds,--this deep Vale, as it doth in part\nConceal us from the storm, so here abides\nA power and a protection for the mind,\nDispensed indeed to other solitudes\nFavoured by noble privilege like this,\nWhere kindred independence of estate\nIs prevalent, where he who tills the field,\nHe, happy man! is master of the field,\nAnd treads the mountains which his Fathers trod.\n\nNot less than halfway up yon mountain's side,\nBehold a dusky spot, a grove of Firs\nThat seems still smaller than it is; this grove\nIs haunted--by what ghost?\n\na gentle spirit\nOf memory faithful to the call of love;\nFor, as reports the Dame, whose fire sends up\nYon curling smoke from the grey cot below,\nThe trees (her first-born child being then a babe)\nWere planted by her husband and herself,\nThat ranging o'er the high and houseless ground\nTheir sheep might neither want from perilous storm\nOf winter, nor from summer's sultry heat,\nA friendly covert; \"and they knew it well,\"\nSaid she, \"for thither as the trees grew up\nWe to the patient creatures carried food\nIn times of heavy snow.\n\n\" She then began\nIn fond obedience to her private thoughts\nTo speak of her dead husband; is there not\nAn art, a music, and a strain of words\nThat shall be life, the acknowledged voice of life,\nShall speak of what is done among the fields,\nDone truly there, or felt, of solid good\nAnd real evil, yet be sweet withal,\nMore grateful, more harmonious than the breath,\nThe idle breath of softest pipe attuned\nTo pastoral fancies?\n\nIs there such a stream\nPure and unsullied flowing from the heart\nWith motions of true dignity and grace?\n\nOr must we seek that stream where Man is not?\n\nMethinks I could repeat in tuneful verse,\nDelicious as the gentlest breeze that sounds\nThrough that aerial fir-grove--could preserve\nSome portion of its human history\nAs gathered from the Matron's lips, and tell\nOf tears that have been shed at sight of it,\nAnd moving dialogues between this Pair\nWho in their prime of wedlock, with joint hands\nDid plant the grove, now flourishing, while they\nNo longer flourish, he entirely gone,\nShe withering in her loneliness.\n\nBe this\nA task above my skill--the silent mind\nHas her own treasures, and I think of these,\nLove what I see, and honour humankind.\n\nNo, we are not alone, we do not stand,\nMy sister here misplaced and desolate,\nLoving what no one cares for but ourselves,\nWe shall not scatter through the plains and rocks\nOf this fair Vale, and o'er its spacious heights,\nUnprofitable kindliness, bestowed\nOn objects unaccustomed to the gifts\nOf feeling, which were cheerless and forlorn\nBut few weeks past, and would be so again\nWere we not here; we do not tend a lamp\nWhose lustre we alone participate,\nWhich shines dependent upon us alone,\nMortal though bright, a dying, dying flame.\n\nLook where we will, some human hand has been\nBefore us with its offering; not a tree\nSprinkles these little pastures, but the same\nHath furnished matter for a thought; perchance\nFor some one serves as a familiar friend.\n\nJoy spreads, and sorrow spreads; and this whole Vale,\nHome of untutored shepherds as it is,\nSwarms with sensation, as with gleams of sunshine,\nShadows or breezes, scents or sounds.\n\nNor deem\nThese feelings, though subservient more than ours\nTo every day's demand for daily bread,\nAnd borrowing more their spirit and their shape\nFrom self-respecting interests; deem them not\nUnworthy therefore, and unhallowed--no,\nThey lift the animal being, do themselves\nBy nature's kind and ever-present aid\nRefine the selfishness from which they spring,\nRedeem by love the individual sense\nOf anxiousness, with which they are combined.\n\nAnd thus it is that fitly they become\nAssociates in the joy of purest minds:\nThey blend therewith congenially: meanwhile\nCalmly they breathe their own undying life\nThrough this their mountain sanctuary; long\nOh long may it remain inviolate,\nDiffusing health and sober cheerfulness,\nAnd giving to the moments as they pass\nTheir little boons of animating thought\nThat sweeten labour, make it seen and felt\nTo be no arbitrary weight imposed,\nBut a glad function natural to man.\n\nFair proof of this, newcomer though I be,\nAlready have I gained; the inward frame,\nThough slowly opening, opens every day\nWith process not unlike to that which cheers\nA pensive stranger journeying at his leisure\nThrough some Helvetian Dell; when low-hung mists\nBreak up and are beginning to recede;\nHow pleased he is where thin and thinner grows\nThe veil, or where it parts at once, to spy\nThe dark pines thrusting forth their spiky heads;\nTo watch the spreading lawns with cattle grazed;\nThen to be greeted by the scattered huts\nAs they shine out; and 'see' the streams whose murmur\nHad soothed his ear while 'they' were hidden; how pleased\nTo have about him which way e'er he goes\nSomething on every side concealed from view,\nIn every quarter something visible\nHalf seen or wholly, lost and found again,\nAlternate progress and impediment,\nAnd yet a growing prospect in the main.\n\nSuch pleasure now is mine, albeit forced,\nHerein less happy than the Traveller,\nTo cast from time to time a painful look\nUpon unwelcome things which unawares\nReveal themselves, not therefore is my heart\nDepressed, nor does it fear what is to come;\nBut confident, enriched at every glance,\nThe more I see the more delight my mind\nReceives, or by reflection can create:\nTruth justifies herself, and as she dwells\nWith Hope, who would not follow where she leads?\n\nNor let me pass unheeded other loves\nWhere no fear is, and humbler sympathies.\n\nAlready hath sprung up within my heart\nA liking for the small grey horse that bears\nThe paralytic man, and for the brute\nIn Scripture sanctified--the patient brute\nOn which the cripple, in the quarry maimed,\nRides to and fro: I know them and their ways.\n\nThe famous sheep-dog, first in all the vale,\nThough yet to me a stranger, will not be\nA stranger long; nor will the blind man's guide,\nMeek and neglected thing, of no renown!\nSoon will peep forth the primrose, ere it fades\nFriends shall I have at dawn, blackbird and thrush\nTo rouse me, and a hundred warblers more!\nAnd if those Eagles to their ancient hold\nReturn, Helvellyn's Eagles! with the Pair\nFrom my own door I shall be free to claim\nAcquaintance, as they sweep from cloud to cloud.\n\nThe owl that gives the name to Owlet-Crag\nHave I heard whooping, and he soon will be\nA chosen one of my regards.\n\nSee there\nThe heifer in yon little croft belongs\nTo one who holds it dear; with duteous care\nShe reared it, and in speaking of her charge\nI heard her scatter some endearing words\nDomestic, and in spirit motherly,\nShe being herself a mother; happy Beast,\nIf the caresses of a human voice\nCan make it so, and care of human hands.\n\nAnd ye as happy under Nature's care,\nStrangers to me and all men, or at least\nStrangers to all particular amity,\nAll intercourse of knowledge or of love\nThat parts the individual from his kind.\n\nWhether in large communities ye keep\nFrom year to year, not shunning man's abode,\nA settled residence, or be from far\nWild creatures, and of many homes, that come\nThe gift of winds, and whom the winds again\nTake from us at your pleasure; yet shall ye\nNot want for this your own subordinate place\nIn my affections.\n\nWitness the delight\nWith which erewhile I saw that multitude\nWheel through the sky, and see them now at rest,\nYet not at rest upon the glassy lake:\nThey 'cannot' rest--they gambol like young whelps;\nActive as lambs, and overcome with joy\nThey try all frolic motions; flutter, plunge,\nAnd beat the passive water with their wings.\n\nToo distant are they for plain view, but lo!\nThose little fountains, sparkling in the sun,\nBetray their occupation, rising up\nFirst one and then another silver spout,\nAs one or other takes the fit of glee,\nFountains and spouts, yet somewhat in the guise\nOf plaything fireworks, that on festal nights\nSparkle about the feet of wanton boys.\n\n--How vast the compass of this theatre,\nYet nothing to be seen but lovely pomp\nAnd silent majesty; the birch-tree woods\nAre hung with thousand thousand diamond drops\nOf melted hoar-frost, every tiny knot\nIn the bare twigs, each little budding-place\nCased with its several beads; what myriads these\nUpon one tree, while all the distant grove,\nThat rises to the summit of the steep,\nShows like a mountain built of silver light:\nSee yonder the same pageant, and again\nBehold the universal imagery\nInverted, all its sun-bright features touched\nAs with the varnish and the gloss of dreams.\n\nDreamlike the blending also of the whole\nHarmonious landscape: all along the shore\nThe boundary lost--the line invisible\nThat parts the image from reality;\nAnd the clear hills, as high as they ascend\nHeavenward, so deep piercing the lake below.\n\nAdmonished of the days of love to come\nThe raven croaks, and fills the upper air\nWith a strange sound of genial harmony;\nAnd in and all about that playful band,\nIncapable although they be of rest,\nAnd in their fashion very rioters,\nThere is a stillness, and they seem to make\nCalm revelry in that their calm abode.\n\nThem leaving to their joyous hours I pass,\nPass with a thought the life of the whole year\nThat is to come: the throng of woodland flowers\nAnd lilies that will dance upon the waves.\n\nSay boldly then that solitude is not\nWhere these things are: he truly is alone,\nHe of the multitude whose eyes are doomed\nTo hold a vacant commerce day by day\nWith Objects wanting life--repelling love;\nHe by the vast metropolis immured,\nWhere pity shrinks from unremitting calls,\nWhere numbers overwhelm humanity,\nAnd neighbourhood serves rather to divide\nThan to unite--what sighs more deep than his,\nWhose nobler will hath long been sacrificed;\nWho must inhabit under a black sky\nA city, where, if indifference to disgust\nYield not to scorn or sorrow, living men\nAre ofttimes to their fellow-men no more\nThan to the forest Hermit are the leaves\nThat hang aloft in myriads; nay, far less,\nFor they protect his walk from sun and shower,\nSwell his devotion with their voice in storms,\nAnd whisper while the stars twinkle among them\nHis lullaby.\n\nFrom crowded streets remote,\nFar from the living and dead Wilderness\nOf the thronged world, Society is here\nA true community--a genuine frame\nOf many into one incorporate.\n\n'That' must be looked for here: paternal sway,\nOne household, under God, for high and low,\nOne family and one mansion; to themselves\nAppropriate, and divided from the world,\nAs if it were a cave, a multitude\nHuman and brute, possessors undisturbed\nOf this Recess--their legislative Hall,\nTheir Temple, and their glorious Dwelling-place.\n\nDismissing therefore all Arcadian dreams,\nAll golden fancies of the golden age,\nThe bright array of shadowy thoughts from times\nThat were before all time, or are to be\nEre time expire, the pageantry that stirs\nOr will be stirring, when our eyes are fixed\nOn lovely objects, and we wish to part\nWith all remembrance of a jarring world,\n--Take we at once this one sufficient hope,\nWhat need of more?\n\nthat we shall neither droop\nNor pine for want of pleasure in the life\nScattered about us, nor through want of aught\nThat keeps in health the insatiable mind.\n\n--That we shall have for knowledge and for love\nAbundance, and that feeling as we do\nHow goodly, how exceeding fair, how pure\nFrom all reproach is yon ethereal vault,\nAnd this deep Vale, its earthly counterpart,\nBy which and under which we are enclosed\nTo breathe in peace; we shall moreover find\n(If sound, and what we ought to be ourselves,\nIf rightly we observe and justly weigh)\nThe inmates not unworthy of their home,\nThe Dwellers of their Dwelling.\n\nAnd if this\nWere otherwise, we have within ourselves\nEnough to fill the present day with joy,\nAnd overspread the future years with hope,\nOur beautiful and quiet home, enriched\nAlready with a stranger whom we love\nDeeply, a stranger of our Father's house,\nA never-resting Pilgrim of the Sea,\nWho finds at last an hour to his content\nBeneath our roof.\n\nAnd others whom we love\nWill seek us also, Sisters of our hearts,\nAnd one, like them, a Brother of our hearts,\nPhilosopher and Poet, in whose sight\nThese mountains will rejoice with open joy.\n\n--Such is our wealth! O Vale of Peace we are\nAnd must be, with God's will, a happy Band.\n\nYet 'tis not to enjoy that we exist,\nFor that end only; something must be done:\nI must not walk in unreproved delight\nThese narrow bounds, and think of nothing more,\nNo duty that looks further, and no care.\n\nEach Being has his office, lowly some\nAnd common, yet all worthy if fulfilled\nWith zeal, acknowledgment that with the gift\nKeeps pace a harvest answering to the seed.\n\nOf ill-advised Ambition and of Pride\nI would stand clear, but yet to me I feel\nThat an internal brightness is vouchsafed\nThat must not die, that must not pass away.\n\nWhy does this inward lustre fondly seek\nAnd gladly blend with outward fellowship?\n\nWhy do 'they' shine around me whom I love?\n\nWhy do they teach me, whom I thus revere?\n\nStrange question, yet it answers not itself.\n\nThat humble Roof embowered among the trees,\nThat calm fireside, it is not even in them,\nBlest as they are, to furnish a reply\nThat satisfies and ends in perfect rest.\n\nPossessions have I that are solely mine,\nSomething within which yet is shared by none,\nNot even the nearest to me and most dear,\nSomething which power and effort may impart;\nI would impart it, I would spread it wide:\nImmortal in the world which is to come--\nForgive me if I add another claim--\nAnd would not wholly perish even in this,\nLie down and be forgotten in the dust,\nI and the modest Partners of my days\nMaking a silent company in death;\nLove, knowledge, all my manifold delights,\nAll buried with me without monument\nOr profit unto any but ourselves!\nIt must not be, if I, divinely taught,\nBe privileged to speak as I have felt\nOf what in man is human or divine.\n\nWhile yet an innocent little one, with a heart\nThat doubtless wanted not its tender moods,\nI breathed (for this I better recollect)\nAmong wild appetites and blind desires,\nMotions of savage instinct my delight\nAnd exaltation.\n\nNothing at that time\nSo welcome, no temptation half so dear\nAs that which urged me to a daring feat,\nDeep pools, tall trees, black chasms, and dizzy crags,\nAnd tottering towers: I loved to stand and read\nTheir looks forbidding, read and disobey,\nSometimes in act and evermore in thought.\n\nWith impulses, that scarcely were by these\nSurpassed in strength, I heard of danger met\nOr sought with courage; enterprise forlorn\nBy one, sole keeper of his own intent,\nOr by a resolute few, who for the sake\nOf glory fronted multitudes in arms.\n\nYea, to this hour I cannot read a Tale\nOf two brave vessels matched in deadly fight,\nAnd fighting to the death, but I am pleased\nMore than a wise man ought to be; I wish,\nFret, burn, and struggle, and in soul am there.\n\nBut me hath Nature tamed, and bade to seek\nFor other agitations, or be calm;\nHath dealt with me as with a turbulent stream,\nSome nursling of the mountains which she leads\nThrough quiet meadows, after he has learnt\nHis strength, and had his triumph and his joy,\nHis desperate course of tumult and of glee.\n\nThat which in stealth by Nature was performed\nHath Reason sanctioned: her deliberate Voice\nHath said; be mild, and cleave to gentle things,\nThy glory and thy happiness be there.\n\nNor fear, though thou confide in me, a want\nOf aspirations that have been--of foes\nTo wrestle with, and victory to complete,\nBounds to be leapt, darkness to be explored;\nAll that inflamed thy infant heart, the love,\nThe longing, the contempt, the undaunted quest,\nAll shall survive, though changed their office, all\nShall live, it is not in their power to die.\n\nThen farewell to the Warrior's Schemes, farewell\nThe forwardness of soul which looks that way\nUpon a less incitement than the Cause\nOf Liberty endangered, and farewell\nThat other hope, long mine, the hope to fill\nThe heroic trumpet with the Muse's breath!\nYet in this peaceful Vale we will not spend\nUnheard-of days, though loving peaceful thought,\nA voice shall speak, and what will be the theme?\n\nOn Man, on Nature, and on Human Life,\nMusing in solitude, I oft perceive\nFair trains of imagery before me rise,\nAccompanied by feelings of delight\nPure, or with no unpleasing sadness mixed;\nAnd I am conscious of affecting thoughts\nAnd dear remembrances, whose presence soothes\nOr elevates the Mind, intent to weigh\nThe good and evil of our mortal state.\n\n--To these emotions, whencesoe'er they come,\nWhether from breath of outward circumstance,\nOr from the Soul--an impulse to herself--\nI would give utterance in numerous verse.\n\nOf Truth, of Grandeur, Beauty, Love, and Hope,\nAnd melancholy Fear subdued by Faith;\nOf blessed consolations in distress;\nOf moral strength, and intellectual Power;\nOf joy in widest commonalty spread;\nOf the individual Mind that keeps her own\nInviolate retirement, subject there\nTo Conscience only, and the law supreme\nOf that Intelligence which governs all--\nI sing:--\"fit audience let me find though few!\"\nSo prayed, more gaining than he asked, the Bard--\nIn holiest mood.\n\nUrania, I shall need\nThy guidance, or a greater Muse, if such\nDescend to earth or dwell in highest heaven!\nFor I must tread on shadowy ground, must sink\nDeep--and, aloft ascending, breathe in worlds\nTo which the heaven of heavens is but a veil.\n\nAll strength--all terror, single or in bands,\nThat ever was put forth in personal form--\nJehovah--with his thunder, and the choir\nOf shouting Angels, and the empyreal thrones--\nI pass them unalarmed.\n\nNot Chaos, not\nThe darkest pit of lowest Erebus,\nNor aught of blinder vacancy, scooped out\nBy help of dreams--can breed such fear and awe\nAs fall upon us often when we look\nInto our Minds, into the Mind of Man--\nMy haunt, and the main region of my song\n--Beauty--a living Presence of the earth,\nSurpassing the most fair ideal Forms\nWhich craft of delicate Spirits hath composed\nFrom earth's materials--waits upon my steps;\nPitches her tents before me as I move,\nAn hourly neighbour.\n\nParadise, and groves\nElysian, Fortunate Fields--like those of old\nSought in the Atlantic Main--why should they be\nA history only of departed things,\nOr a mere fiction of what never was?\n\nFor the discerning intellect of Man,\nWhen wedded to this goodly universe\nIn love and holy passion, shall find these\nA simple produce of the common day.\n\n--I, long before the blissful hour arrives,\nWould chant, in lonely peace, the spousal verse\nOf this great consummation:--and, by words\nWhich speak of nothing more than what we are,\nWould I arouse the sensual from their sleep\nOf Death, and win the vacant and the vain\nTo noble raptures; while my voice proclaims\nHow exquisitely the individual Mind\n(And the progressive powers perhaps no less\nOf the whole species) to the external World\nIs fitted:--and how exquisitely, too--\nTheme this but little heard of among men--\nThe external World is fitted to the Mind;\nAnd the creation (by no lower name\nCan it be called) which they with blended might\nAccomplish:--this is our high argument.\n\n--Such grateful haunts foregoing, if I oft\nMust turn elsewhere--to travel near the tribes\nAnd fellowships of men, and see ill sights\nOf madding passions mutually inflamed;\nMust hear Humanity in fields and groves\nPipe solitary anguish; or must hang\nBrooding above the fierce confederate storm\nOf sorrow, barricadoed evermore\nWithin the walls of cities--may these sounds\nHave their authentic comment; that even these\nHearing, I be not downcast or forlorn!--\nDescend, prophetic Spirit! that inspir'st\nThe human Soul of universal earth,\nDreaming on things to come; and dost possess\nA metropolitan temple in the hearts\nOf mighty Poets; upon me bestow\nA gift of genuine insight; that my Song\nWith star-like virtue in its place may shine,\nShedding benignant influence, and secure\nItself from all malevolent effect\nOf those mutations that extend their sway\nThroughout the nether sphere!--And if with this\nI mix more lowly matter; with the thing\nContemplated, describe the Mind and Man\nContemplating; and who, and what he was--\nThe transitory Being that beheld\nThis Vision;--when and where, and how he lived;\nBe not this labour useless.\n\nIf such theme\nMay sort with highest objects, then--dread Power!\nWhose gracious favour is the primal source\nOf all illumination--may my Life\nExpress the image of a better time,\nMore wise desires, and simpler manners;--nurse\nMy Heart in genuine freedom:--all pure thoughts\nBe with me;--so shall thy unfailing love\nGuide, and support, and cheer me to the end!\n", "period": "Romantic", "literary_movement": "Romanticism", "register": "Narrative", "rhetorical_genre": "Epideictic", "discursive_structure": "Expository", "discourse_type": "Monologue", "narrative_level": "First person", "diegetic_mimetic": "Extradiegetic", "focalization": "First person internal", "person": "First person singular", "deictic_orientation": "Autocentric", "addressee_type": "Implied", "deictic_object": "Nature", "temporal_orientation": "Retrospective", "temporal_structure": "Flashback", "tradition": "English Romanticism", "mode": "Narrative", "genre": "Poetry", "stanza_structure": "Four-line stanzas with a rhyme scheme of AABB", "meter": "Iambic pentameter", "rhyme": "A rhyming poem"}

may you command\nThe service of Sir Leoline;\nAnd gladly our stout chivalry\nWill he send forth and friends withal\nTo guide and guard you safe and free\nHome to your noble father's hall.\n\nShe rose: and forth with steps they passed\nThat strove to be, and were not, fast.\n\nHer gracious stars the lady blest,\nAnd thus spake on sweet Christabel:\nAll our household are at rest,\nThe hall as silent as the cell;\nSir Leoline is weak in health,\nAnd may not well awakened be,\nBut we will move as if in stealth,\nAnd I beseech your courtesy,\nThis night, to share your couch with me.\n\nThey crossed the moat, and Christabel\nTook the key that fitted well;\nA little door she opened straight,\nAll in the middle of the gate;\nThe gate that was ironed within and without,\nWhere an army in battle array had marched out.\n\nThe lady sank, belike through pain,\nAnd Christabel with might and main\nLifted her up, a weary weight,\nOver the threshold of the gate:\nThen the lady rose again,\nAnd moved, as she were not in pain.\n\nSo free from danger, free from fear,\nThey crossed the court: right glad they were.\n\nAnd Christabel devoutly cried\nTo the lady by her side,\nPraise we the Virgin all divine\nWho hath rescued thee from thy distress!\nAlas, alas! said Geraldine,\nI cannot speak for weariness.\n\nSo free from danger, free from fear,\nThey crossed the court: right glad they were.\n\nOutside her kennel, the mastiff old\nLay fast asleep, in moonshine cold.\n\nThe mastiff old did not awake,\nYet she an angry moan did make!\nAnd what can ail the mastiff bitch?\n\nNever till now she uttered yell\nBeneath the eye of Christabel.\n\nPerhaps it is the owlet's scritch:\nFor what can ail the mastiff bitch?\n\nThey passed the hall, that echoes still,\nPass as lightly as you will!\nThe brands were flat, the brands were dying,\nAmid their own white ashes lying;\nBut when the lady passed, there came\nA tongue of light, a fit of flame;\nAnd Christabel saw the lady's eye,\nAnd nothing else saw she thereby,\nSave the boss of the shield of Sir Leoline tall,\nWhich hung in a murky old niche in the wall.\n\nO softly tread, said Christabel,\nMy father seldom sleepeth well.\n\nSweet Christabel her feet doth bare,\nAnd jealous of the listening air\nThey steal their way from stair to stair,\nNow in glimmer, and now in gloom,\nAnd now they pass the Baron's room,\nAs still as death, with stifled breath!\nAnd now have reached her chamber door;\nAnd now doth Geraldine press down\nThe rushes of the chamber floor.\n\nThe moon shines dim in the open air,\nAnd not a moonbeam enters here.\n\nBut they without its light can see\nThe chamber carved so curiously,\nCarved with figures strange and sweet,\nAll made out of the carver's brain,\nFor a lady's chamber meet:\nThe lamp with twofold silver chain\nIs fastened to an angel's feet.\n\nThe silver lamp burns dead and dim;\nBut Christabel the lamp will trim.\n\nShe trimmed the lamp, and made it bright,\nAnd left it swinging to and fro,\nWhile Geraldine, in wretched plight,\nSank down upon the floor below.\n\nO weary lady, Geraldine,\nI pray you, drink this cordial wine!\nIt is a wine of virtuous powers;\nMy mother made it of wild flowers.\n\nAnd will your mother pity me,\nWho am a maiden most forlorn?\n\nChristabel answered\u2014Woe is me!\nShe died the hour that I was born.\n\nI have heard the grey-haired friar tell\nHow on her death-bed she did say,\nThat she should hear the castle-bell\nStrike twelve upon my wedding-day.\n\nO mother dear! that thou wert here!\nI would, said Geraldine, she were!\n\nBut soon with altered voice, said she\u2014\n'Off, wandering mother! Peak and pine!\nI have power to bid thee flee.\n\nAlas! what ails poor Geraldine?\n\nWhy stares she with unsettled eye?\n\nCan she the bodiless dead espy?\n\nAnd why with hollow voice cries she,\n'Off, woman, off! this hour is mine\u2014\nThough thou her guardian spirit be,\nOff, woman, off! 'tis given to me.\n\n\nThen Christabel knelt by the lady's side,\nAnd raised to heaven her eyes so blue\u2014\nAlas! said she, this ghastly ride\u2014\nDear lady! it hath wildered you!\nThe lady wiped her moist cold brow,\nAnd faintly said, ' 'tis over now!'\n\nAgain the wild-flower wine she drank:\nHer fair large eyes 'gan glitter bright,\nAnd from the floor whereon she sank,\nThe lofty lady stood upright:\nShe was most beautiful to see,\nLike a lady of a far countr\u00e8e.\n\nAnd thus the lofty lady spake\u2014\n'All they who live in the upper sky,\nDo love you, holy Christabel!\nAnd you love them, and for their sake\nAnd for the good which me befel,\nEven I in my degree will try,\nFair maiden, to requite you well.\n\nBut now unrobe yourself; for I\nMust pray, ere yet in bed I lie.\n\n\nQuoth Christabel, So let it be!\nAnd as the lady bade, did she.\n\nHer gentle limbs did she undress,\nAnd lay down in her loveliness.\n\nBut through her brain of weal and woe\nSo many thoughts moved to and fro,\nThat vain it were her lids to close;\nSo half-way from the bed she rose,\nAnd on her elbow did recline\nTo look at the lady Geraldine.\n\nBeneath the lamp the lady bowed,\nAnd slowly rolled her eyes around;\nThen drawing in her breath aloud,\nLike one that shuddered, she unbound\nThe cincture from beneath her breast:\nHer silken robe, and inner vest,\nDropt to her feet, and full in view,\nBehold! her bosom and half her side\u2014\nA sight to dream of, not to tell!\nO shield her! shield sweet Christabel!\n\nYet Geraldine nor speaks nor stirs;\nAh! what a stricken look was hers!\nDeep from within she seems half-way\nTo lift some weight with sick assay,\nAnd eyes the maid and seeks delay;\nThen suddenly, as one defied,\nCollects herself in scorn and pride,\nAnd lay down by the Maiden's side!\u2014\nAnd in her arms the maid she took,\nAh wel-a-day!\nAnd with low voice and doleful look\nThese words did say:\n'In the touch of this bosom there worketh a spell,\nWhich is lord of thy utterance, Christabel!\nThou knowest to-night, and wilt know to-morrow,\nThis mark of my shame, this seal of my sorrow;\nBut vainly thou warrest,\nFor this is alone in\nThy power to declare,\nThat in the dim forest\nThou heard'st a low moaning,\nAnd found'st a bright lady, surpassingly fair;\nAnd didst bring her home with thee in love and in charity,\nTo shield her and shelter her from the damp air.\n\n\nTHE CONCLUSION TO PART I\nIt was a lovely sight to see\nThe lady Christabel, when she\nWas praying at the old oak tree.\n\nAmid the jagg\u00e8d shadows\nOf mossy leafless boughs,\nKneeling in the moonlight,\nTo make her gentle vows;\nHer slender palms together prest,\nHeaving sometimes on her breast;\nHer face resigned to bliss or bale\u2014\nHer face, oh call it fair not pale,\nAnd both blue eyes more bright than clear,\nEach about to have a tear.\n\nWith open eyes (ah woe is me!)\nAsleep, and dreaming fearfully,\nFearfully dreaming, yet, I wis,\nDreaming that alone, which is\u2014\nO sorrow and shame!

By tairn and rill,\nThe night-birds all that hour were still.\n\nBut now they are jubilant anew,\nFrom cliffand tower, tu\u2014whoo! tu\u2014whoo!\nTu\u2014whoo! tu\u2014whoo! from wood and fell!\n\nAnd see! the lady Christabel\nGathers herself from out her trance;\nHer limbs relax, her countenance\nGrows sad and soft; the smooth thin lids\nClose o'er her eyes; and tears she sheds\u2014\nLarge tears that leave the lashes bright!\nAnd oft the while she seems to smile\nAs infants at a sudden light!\n\nYea, she doth smile, and she doth weep,\nLike a youthful hermitess,\nBeauteous in a wilderness,\nWho, praying always, prays in sleep.\n\nAnd, if she move unquietly,\nPerchance, 'tis but the blood so free\nComes back and tingles in her feet.\n\nNo doubt, she hath a vision sweet.\n\nWhat if her guardian spirit 'twere,\nWhat if she knew her mother near?\n\nBut this she knows, in joys and woes,\nThat saints will aid if men will call:\nFor the blue sky bends over all!\n\nPART II\nEach matin bell, the Baron saith,\nKnells us back to a world of death.\n\nThese words Sir Leoline first said,\nWhen he rose and found his lady dead:\nThese words Sir Leoline will say\nMany a morn to his dying day!\n\nAnd hence the custom and law began\nThat still at dawn the sacristan,\nWho duly pulls the heavy bell,\nFive and forty beads must tell\nBetween each stroke\u2014a warning knell,\nWhich not a soul can choose but hear\nFrom Bratha Head to Wyndermere.\n\nSaith Bracy the bard, So let it knell!\nAnd let the drowsy sacristan\nStill count as slowly as he can!\nThere is no lack of such, I ween,\nAs well fill up the space between.\n\nIn Langdale Pike and Witch's Lair,\nAnd Dungeon-ghyll so foully rent,\nWith ropes of rock and bells of air\nThree sinful sextons' ghosts are pent,\nWho all give back, one after t'other,\nThe death-note to their living brother;\nAnd oft too, by the knell offended,\nJust as their one! two! three! is ended,\nThe devil mocks the doleful tale\nWith a merry peal from Borodale.\n\nThe air is still! through mist and cloud\nThat merry peal comes ringing loud;\nAnd Geraldine shakes off her dread,\nAnd rises lightly from the bed;\nPuts on her silken vestments white,\nAnd tricks her hair in lovely plight,\nAnd nothing doubting of her spell\nAwakens the lady Christabel.\n\n'Sleep you, sweet lady Christabel?\n\nI trust that you have rested well.\n\n\nAnd Christabel awoke and spied\nThe same who lay down by her side\u2014\nO rather say, the same whom she\nRaised up beneath the old oak tree!\nNay, fairer yet! and yet more fair!\nFor she belike hath drunken deep\nOf all the blessedness of sleep!\nAnd while she spake, her looks, her air\nSuch gentle thankfulness declare,\nThat (so it seemed) her girded vests\nGrew tight beneath her heaving breasts.\n\n'Sure I have sinn'd!' said Christabel,\n'Now heaven be praised if all be well!'\n\nAnd in low faltering tones, yet sweet,\nDid she the lofty lady greet\nWith such perplexity of mind\nAs dreams too lively leave behind.\n\nSo quickly she rose, and quickly arrayed\nHer maiden limbs, and having prayed\nThat He, who on the cross did groan,\nMight wash away her sins unknown,\nShe forthwith led fair Geraldine\nTo meet her sire, Sir Leoline.\n\nThe lovely maid and the lady tall\nAre pacing both into the hall,\nAnd pacing on through page and groom,\n\nThe Baron rose, and while he prest\nHis gentle daughter to his breast,\nWith cheerful wonder in his eyes\nThe lady Geraldine espies,\nAnd gave such welcome to the same,\nAs might beseem so bright a dame!\n\nBut when he heard the lady's tale,\nAnd when she told her father's name,\nWhy waxed Sir Leoline so pale,\nMurmuring o'er the name again,\nLord Roland de Vaux of Tryermaine?\n\nAlas! they had been friends in youth;\nBut whispering tongues can poison truth;\nAnd constancy lives in realms above;\nAnd life is thorny; and youth is vain;\nAnd to be wroth with one we love\nDoth work like madness in the brain.\n\nAnd thus it chanced, as I divine,\nWith Roland and Sir Leoline.\n\nEach spake words of high disdain\nAnd insult to his heart's best brother:\nThey parted\u2014ne'er to meet again!\nBut never either found another\nTo free the hollow heart from paining\u2014\nThey stood aloof, the scars remaining,\nLike cliffs which had been rent asunder;\nA dreary sea now flows between;\u2014\nBut neither heat, nor frost, nor thunder,\nShall wholly do away, I ween,\nThe marks of that which once hath been.\n\nSir Leoline, a moment's space,\nStood gazing on the damsel's face:\nAnd the youthful Lord of Tryermaine\nCame back upon his heart again.\n\nO then the Baron forgot his age,\nHis noble heart swelled high with rage;\nHe swore by the wounds in Jesu's side\nHe would proclaim it far and wide,\nWith trump and solemn heraldry,\nThat they, who thus had wronged the dame,\nWere base as spotted infamy!\n'And if they dare deny the same,\nMy herald shall appoint a week,\nAnd let the recreant traitors seek\nMy tourney court\u2014that there and then\nI may dislodge their reptile souls\nFrom the bodies and forms of men!'\nHe spake: his eye in lightning rolls!\nFor the lady was ruthlessly seized; and he kenned\nIn the beautiful lady the child of his friend!\n\nAnd now the tears were on his face,\nAnd fondly in his arms he took\nFair Geraldine, who met the embrace,\nProlonging it with joyous look.\n\nWhich when she viewed, a vision fell\nUpon the soul of Christabel,\nThe vision of fear, the touch and pain!\nShe shrunk and shuddered, and saw again\u2014\n(Ah, woe is me! Was it for thee,\nThou gentle maid! such sights to see?\n\n\nAgain she saw that bosom old,\nAgain she felt that bosom cold,\nAnd drew in her breath with a hissing sound:\nWhereat the Knight turned wildly round,\nAnd nothing saw, but his own sweet maid\nWith eyes upraised, as one that prayed.\n\nThe touch, the sight, had passed away,\nAnd in its stead that vision blest,\nWhich comforted her after-rest\nWhile in the lady's arms she lay,\nHad put a rapture in her breast,\nAnd on her lips and o'er her eyes\nSpread smiles like light!\nWith new surprise,\n'What ails then my belov\u00e8d child?\n\nThe Baron said\u2014His daughter mild\nMade answer, 'All will yet be well!'\nI ween, she had no power to tell\nAught else: so mighty was the spell.\n\nYet he, who saw this Geraldine,\nHad deemed her sure a thing divine:\nSuch sorrow with such grace she blended,\nAs if she feared she had offended\nSweet Christabel, that gentle maid!\nAnd with such lowly tones she prayed\nShe might be sent without delay\nHome to her father's mansion.\n\n'Nay!\nNay, by my soul!' said Leoline.\n\n'Ho! Bracy the bard, the charge be thine!\nGo thou, with sweet music and loud,\nAnd take two steeds with trappings proud,\nAnd take the youth whom thou lov'st best\nTo bear thy harp, and learn thy song,\nAnd clothe you both in solemn vest,\nAnd over the mountains haste along,\nLest wandering folk, that are abroad,\nDetain you on the valley road.\n\n'And when he has crossed the Irthing flood,\nMy merry bard! he hastes, he hastes\nUp Knorren Moor, through Halegarth Wood,\nAnd reaches soon that castle good\nWhich stands and threatens Scotland's wastes.\n\n'Bard Bracy! bard Bracy! your horses are fleet,\nYe must ride up the hall, your music so sweet,\nMore loud than your horses' echoing feet!\nAnd loud and loud to Lord Roland call,\nThy daughter is safe in Langdale hall!\nThy beautiful daughter is safe and free\u2014\nSir Leoline greets thee thus through me!\nHe bids thee come without delay\nWith all thy numerous array\nAnd take thy lovely daughter home:\nAnd he will meet thee on the way\nWith all his numerous array\nWhite with their panting palfreys' foam:\nAnd, by mine honour! I will say,\nThat I repent me of the day\nWhen I spake words of fierce disdain\nTo Roland de Vaux of Tryermaine!\u2014\n\u2014For since that evil hour hath flown,\nMany a summer's sun hath shone;\nYet ne'er found I a friend again\nLike Roland de Vaux of Tryermaine.\n\nThe lady fell, and clasped his knees,\nHer face upraised, her eyes o'erflowing;\nAnd Bracy replied, with faltering voice,\nHis gracious Hail on all bestowing!\u2014\n'Thy words, thou sire of Christabel,\nAre sweeter than my harp can tell;\nYet might I gain a boon of thee,\nThis day my journey should not be,\nSo strange a dream hath come to me,\nThat I had vowed with music loud\nTo clear yon wood from thing unblest.\n\nWarned by a vision in my rest!\nFor in my sleep I saw that dove,\nThat gentle bird, whom thou dost love,\nAnd call'st by thy own daughter's name\u2014\nSir Leoline! I saw the same\nFluttering, and uttering fearful moan,\nAmong the green herbs in the forest alone.\n\nWhich when I saw and when I heard,\nI wonder'd what might ail the bird;\nFor nothing near it could I see\nSave the grass and green herbs underneath the old tree.\n\n'And in my dream methought I went\nTo search out what might there be found;\nAnd what the sweet bird's trouble meant,\nThat thus lay fluttering on the ground.\n\nI went and peered, and could descry\nNo cause for her distressful cry;\nBut yet for her dear lady's sake\nI stooped, methought, the dove to take,\nWhen lo! I saw a bright green snake\nCoiled around its wings and neck.\n\nGreen as the herbs on which it couched,\nClose by the dove's its head it crouched;\nAnd with the dove it heaves and stirs,\nSwelling its neck as she swelled hers!\nI woke; it was the midnight hour,\nThe clock was echoing in the tower;\nBut though my slumber was gone by,\nThis dream it would not pass away\u2014\nIt seems to live upon my eye!\n\nAnd thence I vowed this self-same day\nWith music strong and saintly song\nTo wander through the forest bare,\nLest aught unholy loiter there.\n\n\nThus Bracy said: the Baron, the while,\nHalf-listening heard him with a smile;\nThen turned to Lady Geraldine,\nHis eyes made up of wonder and love;\nAnd said in courtly accents fine,\n'Sweet maid, Lord Roland's beauteous dove,\nWith arms more strong than harp or song,\nThy sire and I will crush the snake!'\nHe kissed her forehead as he spake,\nAnd Geraldine in maiden wise\nCasting down her large bright eyes,\nWith blushing cheek and courtesy fine\nShe turned her from Sir Leoline;\nSoftly gathering up her train,\nThat o'er her right arm fell again;\nAnd folded her arms across her chest,\nAnd couched her head upon her breast,\nAnd looked askance at Christabel\nJesu, Maria, shield her well!\n\nA snake's small eye blinks dull and shy;\nAnd the lady's eyes they shrunk in her head,\nEach shrunk up to a serpent's eye\nAnd with somewhat of malice, and more of dread,\nAt Christabel she looked askance!\u2014\nOne moment\u2014and the sight was fled!\nBut Christabel in dizzy trance\nStumbling on the unsteady ground\nShuddered aloud, with a hissing sound;\nAnd Geraldine again turned round,\nAnd like a thing, that sought relief,\nFull of wonder and full of grief,\nShe rolled her large bright eyes divine\nWildly on Sir Leoline.\n\nThe maid, alas! her thoughts are gone,\nShe nothing sees\u2014no sight but one!\nThe maid, devoid of guile and sin,\nI know not how, in fearful wise,\nSo deeply she had drunken in\nThat look, those shrunken serpent eyes,\nThat all her features were resigned\nTo this sole image in her mind:\nAnd passively did imitate\nThat look of dull and treacherous hate!\nAnd thus she stood, in dizzy trance;\nStill picturing that look askance\nWith forced unconscious sympathy\nFull before her father's view\u2014\nAs far as such a look could be\nIn eyes so innocent and blue!\n\nAnd when the trance was o'er, the maid\nPaused awhile, and inly prayed:\nThen falling at the Baron's feet,\n'By my mother's soul do I entreat\nThat thou this woman send away!'\nShe said: and more she could not say:\nFor what she knew she could not tell,\nO'er-mastered by the mighty spell.\n\nWhy is thy cheek so wan and wild,\nSir Leoline?\n\nThy only child\nLies at thy feet, thy joy, thy pride,\nSo fair, so innocent, so mild;\nThe same, for whom thy lady died!\nO by the pangs of her dear mother\nThink thou no evil of thy child!\nFor her, and thee, and for no other,\nShe prayed the moment ere she died:\nPrayed that the babe for whom she died,\nMight prove her dear lord's joy and pride!\nThat prayer her deadly pangs beguiled,\nSir Leoline!\nAnd wouldst thou wrong thy only child,\nHer child and thine?\n\nWithin the Baron's heart and brain\nIf thoughts, like these, had any share,\nThey only swelled his rage and pain,\nAnd did but work confusion there.\n\nHis heart was cleft with pain and rage,\nHis cheeks they quivered, his eyes were wild,\nDishonoured thus in his old age;\nDishonoured by his only child,\nAnd all his hospitality\nTo the wronged daughter of his friend\nBy more than woman's jealousy\nBrought thus to a disgraceful end\u2014\nHe rolled his eye with stern regard\nUpon the gentle minstrel bard,\nAnd said in tones abrupt, austere\u2014\n'Why, Bracy! dost thou loiter here?\n\nI bade thee hence!'

Yes! they wander on\nIn gladness all; but thou, methinks, most glad,\nMy gentle-hearted Charles! for thou hast pined\nAnd hunger'd after Nature, many a year,\nIn the great City pent, winning thy way\nWith sad yet patient soul, through evil and pain\nAnd strange calamity! Ah! slowly sink\nBehind the western ridge, thou glorious Sun!\nShine in the slant beams of the sinking orb,\nYe purple heath-flowers! richlier burn, ye clouds!\nLive in the yellow light, ye distant groves!\nAnd kindle, thou blue Ocean! So my friend\nStruck with deep joy may stand, as I have stood,\nSilent with swimming sense; yea, gazing round\nOn the wide landscape, gaze till all doth seem\nLess gross than bodily; and of such hues\nAs veil the Almighty Spirit, when yet he makes\nSpirits perceive his presence.\n\nA delight\nComes sudden on my heart, and I am glad\nAs I myself were there! Nor in this bower,\nThis little lime-tree bower, have I not mark'd\nMuch that has sooth'd me.\n\nPale beneath the blaze\nHung the transparent foliage; and I watch'd\nSome broad and sunny leaf, and lov'd to see\nThe shadow of the leaf and stem above\nDappling its sunshine! And that walnut-tree\nWas richly ting'd, and a deep radiance lay\nFull on the ancient ivy, which usurps\nThose fronting elms, and now, with blackest mass\nMakes their dark branches gleam a lighter hue\nThrough the late twilight: and though now the bat\nWheels silent by, and not a swallow twitters,\nYet still the solitary humble-bee\nSings in the bean-flower! Henceforth I shall know\nThat Nature ne'er deserts the wise and pure;\nNo plot so narrow, be but Nature there,\nNo waste so vacant, but may well employ\nEach faculty of sense, and keep the heart\nAwake to Love and Beauty! and sometimes\n'Tis well to be bereft of promis'd good,\nThat we may lift the soul, and contemplate\nWith lively joy the joys we cannot share.\n\nMy gentle-hearted Charles! when the last rook\nBeat its straight path along the dusky air\nHomewards, I blest it! deeming its black wing\n(Now a dim speck, now vanishing in light)\nHad cross'd the mighty Orb's dilated glory,\nWhile thou stood'st gazing; or, when all was still,\nFlew creeking o'er thy head, and had a charm\nFor thee, my gentle-hearted Charles, to whom\nNo sound is dissonant which tells of Life.", "period": "Romantic", "literary_movement": "Romanticism", "register": "Admiring", "rhetorical_genre": "Epideictic", "discursive_structure": "Descriptive", "discourse_type": "Expository", "narrative_level": "", "diegetic_mimetic": "Mimetic", "focalization": "First person", "person": "Speaker", "deictic_orientation": "First person", "addressee_type": "Implied", "deictic_object": "Lime-tree bower", "temporal_orientation": "Present", "temporal_structure": "Static", "tradition": "British Romanticism", "mode": "Lyric", "genre": "Poetry", "stanza_structure": "Quatrains", "meter": "Iambic pentameter", "rhyme": "AABB"}

rejoice!\nSounds which will reach the Framer of all things,\nAnd die away in ardent mutterings.\n\nNo one who once the glorious sun has seen,\nAnd all the clouds, and felt his bosom clean\nFor his great Maker's presence, but must know\nWhat 'tis I mean, and feel his being glow:\nTherefore no insult will I give his spirit,\nBy telling what he sees from native merit.\n\nO Poesy! for thee I hold my pen\nThat am not yet a glorious denizen\nOf thy wide heaven- Should I rather kneel\nUpon some mountain-top until I feel\nA glowing splendour round about me hung,\nAnd echo back the voice of thine own tongue?\n\nO Poesy! for thee I grasp my pen\nThat am not yet a glorious denizen\nOf thy wide heaven; yet, to my ardent prayer,\nYield from thy sanctuary some clear air,\nSmooth'd for intoxication by the breath\nOf flowering bays, that I may die a death\nOf luxury, and my young spirit follow\nThe morning sun-beams to the great Apollo\nLike a fresh sacrifice; or, if I can bear\nThe o'erwhelming sweets, 'twill bring to me the fair\nVisions of all places: a bowery nook\nWill be elysium- an eternal book\nWhence I may copy many a lovely saying\nAbout the leaves, and flowers- about the playing\nOf nymphs in woods, and fountains; and the shade\nKeeping a silence round a sleeping maid;\nAnd many a verse from so strange influence\nThat we must ever wonder how, and whence\nIt came.\n\nAlso imaginings will hover\nRound my fire-side, and haply there discover\nVistas of solemn beauty, where I'd wander\nIn happy silence, like the clear Meander\nThrough its lone vales; and where I found a spot\nOf awfuller shade, or an enchanted grot,\nOr a green hill o'erspread with chequer'd dress\nOf flowers, and fearful from its loveliness,\nWrite on my tablets all that was permitted,\nAll that was for our human senses fitted.\n\nThen the events of this wide world I'd seize\nLike a strong giant, and my spirit teaze\nTill at its shoulders it should proudly see\nWings to find out an immortality.\n\nStop and consider!

I see afar,\nO'ersailing the blue cragginess, a car\nAnd steeds with streamy manes- the charioteer\nLooks out upon the winds with glorious fear:\nAnd now the numerous tramplings quiver lightly\nAlong a huge cloud's ridge; and now with sprightly\nWheel downward come they into fresher skies,\nTipt round with silver from the sun's bright eyes.\n\nStill downward with capacious whirl they glide;\nAnd now I see them on the green-hill's side\nIn breezy rest among the nodding stalks.\n\nThe charioteer with wond'rous gesture talks\nTo the trees and mountains; and there soon appear\nShapes of delight, of mystery, and fear,\nPassing along before a dusky space\nMade by some mighty oaks: as they would chase\nSome ever- fleeting music on they sweep.\n\nLo! how they murmur, laugh, and smile, and weep:\nSome with upholden hand and mouth severe;\nSome with their faces muffled to the ear\nBetween their arms; some, clear in youthful bloom,\nGo glad and smilingly athwart the gloom;\nSome looking back, and some with upward gaze;\nYes, thousands in a thousand different ways\nFlit onward- now a lovely wreath of girls\nDancing their sleek hair into tangled curls;\nAnd now broad wings.\n\nMost awfully intent\nThe driver of those steeds is forward bent,\nAnd seems to listen: O that I might know\nAll that he writes with such a hurrying glow.\n\nThe visions all are fled- the car is fled\nInto the light of heaven, and in their stead\nA sense of real things comes doubly strong,\nAnd, like a muddy stream, would bear along\nMy soul to nothingness: but I will strive\nAgainst all doubtings, and will keep alive\nThe thought of that same chariot, and the strange\nJourney it went.\n\nIs there so small a range\nIn the present strength of manhood, that the high\nImagination cannot freely fly\nAs she was wont of old?\n\nprepare her steeds,\nPaw up against the light, and do strange deeds\nUpon the clouds?\n\nHas she not shown us all?\n\nFrom the clear space of ether, to the small\nBreath of new buds unfolding?\n\nFrom the meaning\nOf Jove's large eye-brow, to the tender greening\nOf April meadows?\n\nHere her altar shone,\nE'en in this isle; and who could paragon\nThe fervid choir that lifted up a noise\nOf harmony, to where it aye will poise\nIts mighty self of convoluting sound,\nHuge as a planet, and like that roll round,\nEternally around a dizzy void?\n\nAy, in those days the Muses were nigh cloy'd\nWith honors; nor had any other care\nThan to sing out and sooth their wavy hair.\n\nCould all this be forgotten?\n\nYes, a schism\nNurtured by foppery and barbarism,\nMade great Apollo blush for this his land.\n\nMen were thought wise who could not understand\nHis glories: with a puling infant's force\nThey sway'd about upon a rocking horse,\nAnd thought it Pegasus.\n\nAh dismal soul'd!\nThe winds of heaven blew, the ocean roll'd\nIts gathering waves- ye felt it not.\n\nThe blue\nBared its eternal bosom, and the dew\nOf summer nights collected still to make\nThe morning precious: beauty was awake!\nWhy were ye not awake?\n\nBut ye were dead\nTo things ye knew not of,- were closely wed\nTo musty laws lined out with wretched rule\nAnd compass vile: so that ye taught a school\nOf dolts to smooth, inlay, and clip, and fit,\nTill, like the certain wands of Jacob's wit,\nTheir verses tallied.\n\nEasy was the task:\nA thousand handicraftsmen wore the mask\nOf Poesy.\n\nIll-fated, impious race!\nThat blasphemed the bright Lyrist to his face,\nAnd did not know it,- no, they went about,\nHolding a poor, decrepid standard out\nMark'd with most flimsy mottos, and in large\nThe name of one Boileau!\nO ye whose charge\nIt is to hover round our pleasant hills!\nWhose congregated majesty so fills\nMy boundly reverence, that I cannot trace\nYour hallowed names, in this unholy place,\nSo near those common folk; did not their shames\nAffright you?\n\nDid our old lamenting Thames\nDelight you?\n\nDid ye never cluster round\nDelicious Avon, with a mournful sound,\nAnd weep?\n\nOr did ye wholly bid adieu\nTo regions where no more the laurel grew?\n\nOr did ye stay to give a welcoming\nTo some lone spirits who could proudly sing\nTheir youth away, and die?\n\n'Twas even so:\nBut let me think away those times of woe:\nNow 'tis a fairer season; ye have breathed\nRich benedictions o'er us; ye have wreathed\nFresh garlands: for sweet music has been heard\nIn many places;- some has been upstirr'd\nFrom out its crystal dwelling in a lake,\nBy a swan's ebon bill; from a thick brake,\nNested and quiet in a valley mild,\nBubbles a pipe; fine sounds are floating wild\nAbout the earth: happy are ye and glad.\n\nThese things are doubtless: yet in truth we've had\nStrange thunders from the potency of song;\nMingled indeed with what is sweet and strong,\nFrom majesty: but in clear truth the themes\nAre ugly clubs, the Poets' Polyphemes\nDisturbing the grand sea.\n\nA drainless shower\nOf light is poesy; 'tis the supreme of power;\n'Tis might half slumb'ring on its own right arm.\n\nThe very archings of her eye-lids charm\nA thousand willing agents to obey,\nAnd still she governs with the mildest sway:\nBut strength alone though of the Muses born\nIs like a fallen angel: trees uptorn,\nDarkness, and worms, and shrouds, and sepulchres\nDelight it; for it feeds upon the burrs,\nAnd thorns of life; forgetting the great end\nOf poesy, that it should be a friend\nTo sooth the cares, and lift the thoughts of man.\n\nYet I rejoice: a myrtle fairer than\nE'er grew in Paphos, from the bitter weeds\nLifts its sweet head into the air, and feeds\nA silent space with ever sprouting green.\n\nAll tenderest birds there find a pleasant screen,\nCreep through the shade with jaunty fluttering,\nNibble the little cupped flowers and sing.\n\nThen let us clear away the choking thorns\nFrom round its gentle stem; let the young fawns,\nYeaned in after times, when we are flown,\nFind a fresh sward beneath it, overgrown\nWith simple flowers: let there nothing be\nMore boisterous than a lover's bended knee;\nNought more ungentle than the placid look\nOf one who leans upon a closed book;\nNought more untranquil than the grassy slopes\nBetween two hills.\n\nAll hail delightful hopes!\nAs she was wont, th' imagination\nInto most lovely labyrinths will be gone,\nAnd they shall be accounted poet kings\nWho simply tell the most heart-easing things.\n\nO may these joys be ripe before I die.\n\nWill not some say that I presumptuously\nHave spoken?\n\nthat from hastening disgrace\n'Twere better far to hide my foolish face?\n\nThat whining boyhood should with reverence bow\nEre the dread thunderbolt could reach?\n\nHow!\nIf I do hide myself, it sure shall be\nIn the very fane, the light of Poesy:\nIf I do fall, at least I will be laid\nBeneath the silence of a poplar shade;\nAnd over me the grass shall be smooth shaven;\nAnd there shall be a kind memorial graven.\n\nBut off Despondence! miserable bane!\nThey should not know thee, who athirst to gain\nA noble end, are thirsty every hour.\n\nWhat though I am not wealthy in the dower\nOf spanning wisdom; though I do not know\nThe shiftings of the mighty winds that blow\nHither and thither all the changing thoughts\nOf man: though no great minist'ring reason sorts\nOut the dark mysteries of human souls\nTo clear conceiving: yet there ever rolls\nA vast idea before me, and I glean\nTherefrom my liberty; thence too I've seen\nThe end and aim of Poesy.\n\n'Tis clear\nAs anything most true; as that the year\nIs made of the four seasons- manifest\nAs a large cross, some old cathedral's crest,\nLifted to the white clouds.\n\nTherefore should I\nBe but the essence of deformity,\nA coward, did my very eye-lids wink\nAt speaking out what I have dared to think.\n\nAh! rather let me like a madman run\nOver some precipice; let the hot sun\nMelt my Dedalian wings, and drive me down\nConvuls'd and headlong!

the aged creature came,\nShuffling along with ivory-headed wand,\nTo where he stood, hid from the torch's flame,\nBehind a broad half-pillar, far beyond\nThe sound of merriment and chorus bland:\nHe startled her; but soon she knew his face,\nAnd grasp'd his fingers in her palsied hand,\nSaying, \"Mercy, Porphyro! hie thee from this place;\nThey are all here to-night, the whole blood-thirsty race!\n\n\"Get hence! get hence! there's dwarfish Hildebrand;\nHe had a fever late, and in the fit\nHe cursed thee and thine, both house and land:\nThen there's that old Lord Maurice, not a whit\nMore tame for his gray hairs\u2014Alas me!

and he scarce could brook\nTears, at the thought of those enchantments cold,\nAnd Madeline asleep in lap of legends old.\n\nSudden a thought came like a full-blown rose,\nFlushing his brow, and in his pained heart\nMade purple riot: then doth he propose\nA stratagem, that makes the beldame start:\n\"A cruel man and impious thou art:\nSweet lady, let her pray, and sleep, and dream\nAlone with her good angels, far apart\nFrom wicked men like thee.\n\nGo, go!\u2014I deem\nThou canst not surely be the same that thou didst seem.\n\n\n\"I will not harm her, by all saints I swear,\"\nQuoth Porphyro: \"O may I ne'er find grace\nWhen my weak voice shall whisper its last prayer,\nIf one of her soft ringlets I displace,\nOr look with ruffian passion in her face:\nGood Angela, believe me by these tears;\nOr I will, even in a moment's space,\nAwake, with horrid shout, my foemen's ears,\nAnd beard them, though they be more fang'd than wolves and bears.\n\n\n\"Ah! why wilt thou affright a feeble soul?\n\nA poor, weak, palsy-stricken, churchyard thing,\nWhose passing-bell may ere the midnight toll;\nWhose prayers for thee, each morn and evening,\nWere never miss'd.\n\n\"\u2014Thus plaining, doth she bring\nA gentler speech from burning Porphyro;\nSo woful, and of such deep sorrowing,\nThat Angela gives promise she will do\nWhatever he shall wish, betide her weal or woe.\n\nWhich was, to lead him, in close secrecy,\nEven to Madeline's chamber, and there hide\nHim in a closet, of such privacy\nThat he might see her beauty unespy'd,\nAnd win perhaps that night a peerless bride,\nWhile legion'd faeries pac'd the coverlet,\nAnd pale enchantment held her sleepy-ey'd.\n\nNever on such a night have lovers met,\nSince Merlin paid his Demon all the monstrous debt.\n\n\"It shall be as thou wishest,\" said the Dame:\n\"All cates and dainties shall be stored there\nQuickly on this feast-night: by the tambour frame\nHer own lute thou wilt see: no time to spare,\nFor I am slow and feeble, and scarce dare\nOn such a catering trust my dizzy head.\n\nWait here, my child, with patience; kneel in prayer\nThe while: Ah! thou must needs the lady wed,\nOr may I never leave my grave among the dead.\n\n\nSo saying, she hobbled off with busy fear.\n\nThe lover's endless minutes slowly pass'd;\nThe dame return'd, and whisper'd in his ear\nTo follow her; with aged eyes aghast\nFrom fright of dim espial.\n\nSafe at last,\nThrough many a dusky gallery, they gain\nThe maiden's chamber, silken, hush'd, and chaste;\nWhere Porphyro took covert, pleas'd amain.\n\nHis poor guide hurried back with agues in her brain.\n\nHer falt'ring hand upon the balustrade,\nOld Angela was feeling for the stair,\nWhen Madeline, St.\n\nAgnes' charmed maid,\nRose, like a mission'd spirit, unaware:\nWith silver taper's light, and pious care,\nShe turn'd, and down the aged gossip led\nTo a safe level matting.\n\nNow prepare,\nYoung Porphyro, for gazing on that bed;\nShe comes, she comes again, like ring-dove fray'd and fled.\n\nOut went the taper as she hurried in;\nIts little smoke, in pallid moonshine, died:\nShe clos'd the door, she panted, all akin\nTo spirits of the air, and visions wide:\nNo uttered syllable, or, woe betide!\nBut to her heart, her heart was voluble,\nPaining with eloquence her balmy side;\nAs though a tongueless nightingale should swell\nHer throat in vain, and die, heart-stifled, in her dell.\n\nA casement high and triple-arch'd there was,\nAll garlanded with carven imag'ries\nOf fruits, and flowers, and bunches of knot-grass,\nAnd diamonded with panes of quaint device,\nInnumerable of stains and splendid dyes,\nAs are the tiger-moth's deep-damask'd wings;\nAnd in the midst, 'mong thousand heraldries,\nAnd twilight saints, and dim emblazonings,\nA shielded scutcheon blush'd with blood of queens and kings.\n\nFull on this casement shone the wintry moon,\nAnd threw warm gules on Madeline's fair breast,\nAs down she knelt for heaven's grace and boon;\nRose-bloom fell on her hands, together prest,\nAnd on her silver cross soft amethyst,\nAnd on her hair a glory, like a saint:\nShe seem'd a splendid angel, newly drest,\nSave wings, for heaven:\u2014Porphyro grew faint:\nShe knelt, so pure a thing, so free from mortal taint.\n\nAnon his heart revives: her vespers done,\nOf all its wreathed pearls her hair she frees;\nUnclasps her warmed jewels one by one;\nLoosens her fragrant boddice; by degrees\nHer rich attire creeps rustling to her knees:\nHalf-hidden, like a mermaid in sea-weed,\nPensive awhile she dreams awake, and sees,\nIn fancy, fair St.\n\nAgnes in her bed,\nBut dares not look behind, or all the charm is fled.\n\nSoon, trembling in her soft and chilly nest,\nIn sort of wakeful swoon, perplex'd she lay,\nUntil the poppied warmth of sleep oppress'd\nHer soothed limbs, and soul fatigued away;\nFlown, like a thought, until the morrow-day;\nBlissfully haven'd both from joy and pain;\nClasp'd like a missal where swart Paynims pray;\nBlinded alike from sunshine and from rain,\nAs though a rose should shut, and be a bud again.\n\nStol'n to this paradise, and so entranced,\nPorphyro gaz'd upon her empty dress,\nAnd listen'd to her breathing, if it chanced\nTo wake into a slumberous tenderness;\nWhich when he heard, that minute did he bless,\nAnd breath'd himself: then from the closet crept,\nNoiseless as fear in a wide wilderness,\nAnd over the hush'd carpet, silent, stept,\nAnd 'tween the curtains peep'd, where, lo!\u2014how fast she slept.\n\nThen by the bed-side, where the faded moon\nMade a dim, silver twilight, soft he set\nA table, and, half anguish'd, threw thereon\nA cloth of woven crimson, gold, and jet:\u2014\nO for some drowsy Morphean amulet!\nThe boisterous, midnight, festive clarion,\nThe kettle-drum, and far-heard clarinet,\nAffray his ears, though but in dying tone:\u2014\nThe hall door shuts again, and all the noise is gone.\n\nAnd still she slept an azure-lidded sleep,\nIn blanched linen, smooth, and lavender'd,\nWhile he forth from the closet brought a heap\nOf candied apple, quince, and plum, and gourd;\nWith jellies soother than the creamy curd,\nAnd lucent syrops, tinct with cinnamon;\nManna and dates, in argosy transferr'd\nFrom Fez; and spiced dainties, every one,\nFrom silken Samarcand to cedar'd Lebanon.\n\nThese delicates he heap'd with glowing hand\nOn golden dishes and in baskets bright\nOf wreathed silver: sumptuous they stand\nIn the retired quiet of the night,\nFilling the chilly room with perfume light.\n\n\"And now, my love, my seraph fair, awake!\nThou art my heaven, and I thine eremite:\nOpen thine eyes, for meek St.\n\nAgnes' sake,\nOr I shall drowse beside thee, so my soul doth ache.\n\n\nThus whispering, his warm, unnerved arm\nSank in her pillow.\n\nShaded was her dream\nBy the dusk curtains:\u2014'twas a midnight charm\nImpossible to melt as iced stream:\nThe lustrous salvers in the moonlight gleam;\nBroad golden fringe upon the carpet lies:\nIt seem'd he never, never could redeem\nFrom such a stedfast spell his lady's eyes;\nSo mus'd awhile, entoil'd in woofed phantasies.\n\nAwakening up, he took her hollow lute,\u2014\nTumultuous,\u2014and, in chords that tenderest be,\nHe play'd an ancient ditty, long since mute,\nIn Provence call'd, \"La belle dame sans mercy\":\nClose to her ear touching the melody;\u2014\nWherewith disturb'd, she utter'd a soft moan:\nHe ceas'd\u2014she panted quick\u2014and suddenly\nHer blue affrayed eyes wide open shone:\nUpon his knees he sank, pale as smooth-sculptured stone.\n\nHer eyes were open, but she still beheld,\nNow wide awake, the vision of her sleep:\nThere was a painful change, that nigh expell'd\nThe blisses of her dream so pure and deep\nAt which fair Madeline began to weep,\nAnd moan forth witless words with many a sigh;\nWhile still her gaze on Porphyro would keep;\nWho knelt, with joined hands and piteous eye,\nFearing to move or speak, she look'd so dreamingly.\n\n\"Ah, Porphyro!\" said she, \"but even now\nThy voice was at sweet tremble in mine ear,\nMade tuneable with every sweetest vow;\nAnd those sad eyes were spiritual and clear:\nHow chang'd thou art! how pallid, chill, and drear!\nGive me that voice again, my Porphyro,\nThose looks immortal, those complainings dear!\nOh leave me not in this eternal woe,\nFor if thy diest, my Love, I know not where to go.\n\n\nBeyond a mortal man impassion'd far\nAt these voluptuous accents, he arose\nEthereal, flush'd, and like a throbbing star\nSeen mid the sapphire heaven's deep repose;\nInto her dream he melted, as the rose\nBlendeth its odour with the violet,\u2014\nSolution sweet: meantime the frost-wind blows\nLike Love's alarum pattering the sharp sleet\nAgainst the window-panes; St.\n\nAgnes' moon hath set.\n\n'Tis dark: quick pattereth the flaw-blown sleet:\n\"This is no dream, my bride, my Madeline!\"\n'Tis dark: the iced gusts still rave and beat:\n\"No dream, alas! alas! and woe is mine!\nPorphyro will leave me here to fade and pine.\n\nCruel! what traitor could thee hither bring?\n\nI curse not, for my heart is lost in thine,\nThough thou forsakest a deceived thing;\u2014\nA dove forlorn and lost with sick unpruned wing.\n\n\n\"My Madeline! sweet dreamer! lovely bride!\nSay, may I be for aye thy vassal blest?\n\nThy beauty's shield, heart-shap'd and vermeil dyed?\n\nAh, silver shrine, here will I take my rest\nAfter so many hours of toil and quest,\nA famish'd pilgrim,\u2014sav'd by miracle.\n\nThough I have found, I will not rob thy nest\nSaving of thy sweet self;

the porches wide\nOpen'd upon the dusk demesnes of night;\nAnd the bright Titan, phrenzied with new woes,\nUnus'd to bend, by hard compulsion bent\nHis spirit to the sorrow of the time;\nAnd all along a dismal rack of clouds,\nUpon the boundaries of day and night,\nHe stretch'd himself in grief and radiance faint.\n\nThere as he lay, the Heaven with its stars\nLook'd down on him with pity, and the voice\nOf Coelus, from the universal space,\nThus whisper'd low and solemn in his ear.\n\n\"O brightest of my children dear, earth-born\nAnd sky-engendered, Son of Mysteries\nAll unrevealed even to the powers\nWhich met at thy creating;

sea,\nPassed the Pageant swift and free,\nTearing up, and trampling down;\nTill they came to London town.\n\nXIV.\n\nAnd each dweller, panic-stricken,\nFelt his heart with terror sicken\nHearing the tempestuous cry\nOf the triumph of Anarchy.\n\nXV.\n\nFor with pomp to meet him came,\nClothed in arms like blood and flame,\nThe hired murderers, who did sing\n'Thou art God, and Law, and King.\n\nXVI.\n\n'We have waited, weak and lone\nFor thy coming, Mighty One!\nOur purses are empty, our swords are cold,\nGive us glory, and blood, and gold.\n\nXVII.\n\nLawyers and priests, a motley crowd,\nTo the earth their pale brows bowed;\nLike a bad prayer not over loud,\nWhispering\u2014'Thou art Law and God.\n\nXVIII.\n\nThen all cried with one accord,\n'Thou art King, and God, and Lord;\nAnarchy, to thee we bow,\nBe thy name made holy now!'\nXIX.\n\nAnd Anarchy, the Skeleton,\nBowed and grinned to every one,\nAs well as if his education\nHad cost ten millions to the nation.\n\nXX.\n\nFor he knew the Palaces\nOf our Kings were rightly his;\nHis the sceptre, crown, and globe,\nAnd the gold-inwoven robe.\n\nXXI.\n\nSo he sent his slaves before\nTo seize upon the Bank and Tower,\nAnd was proceeding with intent\nTo meet his pensioned Parliament\nXXII.\n\nWhen one fled past, a maniac maid,\nAnd her name was Hope, she said:\nBut she looked more like Despair,\nAnd she cried out in the air:\nXXIII.\n\n'My father Time is weak and gray\nWith waiting for a better day;\nSee how idiot-like he stands,\nFumbling with his palsied hands!\nXXIV.\n\n'He has had child after child,\nAnd the dust of death is piled\nOver every one but me\u2014\nMisery, oh, Misery!'\nXXV.\n\nThen she lay down in the street,\nRight before the horses' feet,\nExpecting, with a patient eye,\nMurder, Fraud, and Anarchy.\n\nXXVI.\n\nWhen between her and her foes\nA mist, a light, an image rose,\nSmall at first, and weak, and frail\nLike the vapour of a vale:\nXXVII.\n\nTill as clouds grow on the blast,\nLike tower-crowned giants striding fast,\nAnd glare with lightnings as they fly,\nAnd speak in thunder to the sky,\nXXVIII.\n\nIt grew\u2014a Shape arrayed in mail\nBrighter than the viper's scale,\nAnd upborne on wings whose grain\nWas as the light of sunny rain.\n\nXXIX.\n\nOn its helm, seen far away,\nA planet, like the Morning's, lay;\nAnd those plumes its light rained through\nLike a shower of crimson dew.\n\nXXX.\n\nWith step as soft as wind it passed\nO'er the heads of men\u2014so fast\nThat they knew the presence there,\nAnd looked,\u2014but all was empty air.\n\nXXXI.\n\nAs flowers beneath May's footstep waken,\nAs stars from Night's loose hair are shaken,\nAs waves arise when loud winds call,\nThoughts sprung where'er that step did fall.\n\nXXXII.\n\nAnd the prostrate multitude\nLooked-and ankle-deep in blood,\nHope, that maiden most serene,\nWas walking with a quiet mien:\nXXXIII.\n\nAnd Anarchy, the ghastly birth,\nLay dead earth upon the earth;\nThe Horse of Death tameless as wind\nFled, and with his hoofs did grind\nTo dust the murderers thronged behind.\n\nXXXIV.\n\nA rushing light of clouds and splendour,\nA sense awakening and yet tender\nWas heard and felt\u2014and at its close\nThese words of joy and fear arose\nXXXV.\n\nAs if their own indignant Earth\nWhich gave the sons of England birth\nHad felt their blood upon her brow,\nAnd shuddering with a mother's throe\nXXXVI.\n\nHad turn\u00e8d every drop of blood\nBy which her face had been bedewed\nTo an accent unwithstood,\u2014\nAs if her heart had cried aloud:\nXXXVII.\n\n'Men of England, heirs of Glory,\nHeroes of unwritten story,\nNurslings of one mighty Mother,\nHopes of her, and one another;\nXXXVIII.\n\n'Rise like Lions after slumber\nIn unvanquishable number,\nShake your chains to earth like dew\nWhich in sleep had fallen on you\u2014\nYe are many\u2014they are few.\n\nXXXIX.\n\n'What is Freedom?\n\n\u2014ye can tell\nThat which slavery is, too well\u2014\nFor its very name has grown\nTo an echo of your own.\n\nXL.\n\n''Tis to work and have such pay\nAs just keeps life from day to day\nIn your limbs, as in a cell\nFor the tyrants' use to dwell,\nXLI.\n\n'So that ye for them are made\nLoom, and plough, and sword, and spade,\nWith or without your own will bent\nTo their defence and nourishment.\n\nXLII.\n\n''Tis to see your children weak\nWith their mothers pine and peak,\nWhen the winter winds are bleak,\u2014\nThey are dying whilst I speak.\n\nXLIII.\n\n''Tis to hunger for such diet\nAs the rich man in his riot\nCasts to the fat dogs that lie\nSurfeiting beneath his eye;\nXLIV.\n\n''Tis to let the Ghost of Gold\nTake from Toil a thousandfold\nMore than e'er its substance could\nIn the tyrannies of old.\n\nXLV.\n\n'Paper coin\u2014that forgery\nOf the title-deeds, which ye\nHold to something of the worth\nOf the inheritance of Earth.\n\nXLVI.\n\n''Tis to be a slave in soul\nAnd to hold no strong control\nOver your own wills, but be\nAll that others make of ye.\n\nXLVII.\n\n'And at length when ye complain\nWith a murmur weak and vain\n'Tis to see the Tyrant's crew\nRide over your wives and you\u2014\nBlood is on the grass like dew.\n\nXLVIII.\n\n'Then it is to feel revenge\nFiercely thirsting to exchange\nBlood for blood\u2014and wrong for wrong\u2014\nDo not thus when ye are strong.\n\nXLIX.\n\n'Birds find rest, in narrow nest\nWhen weary of their wing\u00e8d quest;\nBeasts find fare, in woody lair\nWhen storm and snow are in the air[1].\n\nL.\n\n'Asses, swine, have litter spread\nAnd with fitting food are fed;\nAll things have a home but one\u2014\nThou, Oh, Englishman, hast none!\nLI.\n\n'This is Slavery\u2014savage men,\nOr wild beasts within a den\nWould endure not as ye do\u2014\nBut such ills they never knew.\n\nLII.\n\n'What art thou Freedom?\n\nO! could slaves\nAnswer from their living graves\nThis demand\u2014tyrants would flee\nLike a dream's dim imagery:\nLIII.\n\n'Thou art not, as impostors say,\nA shadow soon to pass away,\nA superstition, and a name\nEchoing from the cave of Fame.\n\nLIV.\n\n'For the labourer thou art bread,\nAnd a comely table spread\nFrom his daily labour come\nIn a neat and happy home.\n\nLV.\n\n'Thou art clothes, and fire, and food\nFor the trampled multitude\u2014\nNo\u2014in countries that are free\nSuch starvation cannot be\nAs in England now we see.\n\nLVI.\n\n'To the rich thou art a check,\nWhen his foot is on the neck\nOf his victim, thou dost make\nThat he treads upon a snake.\n\nLVII.\n\n'Thou art Justice\u2014ne'er for gold\nMay thy righteous laws be sold\nAs laws are in England\u2014thou\nShield'st alike the high and low.\n\nLVIII.\n\n'Thou art Wisdom\u2014Freemen never\nDream that God will damn for ever\nAll who think those things untrue\nOf which Priests make such ado.\n\nLIX.\n\n'Thou art Peace\u2014never by thee\nWould blood and treasure wasted be\nAs tyrants wasted them, when all\nLeagued to quench thy flame in Gaul.\n\nLX.\n\n'What if English toil and blood\nWas poured forth, even as a flood?\n\nIt availed, Oh, Liberty,\nTo dim, but not extinguish thee.\n\nLXI.\n\n'Thou art Love\u2014the rich have kissed\nThy feet, and like him following Christ,\nGive their substance to the free\nAnd through the rough world follow thee,\nLXII.\n\n'Or turn their wealth to arms, and make\nWar for thy belov\u00e8d sake\nOn wealth, and war, and fraud\u2014whence they\nDrew the power which is their prey.\n\nLXIII.\n\n'Science, Poetry, and Thought\nAre thy lamps; they make the lot\nOf the dwellers in a cot\nSo serene, they curse it not.\n\nLXIV.\n\n'Spirit, Patience, Gentleness,\nAll that can adorn and bless\nArt thou\u2014let deeds, not words, express\nThine exceeding loveliness.\n\nLXV.\n\n'Let a great Assembly be\nOf the fearless and the free\nOn some spot of English ground\nWhere the plains stretch wide around.\n\nLXVI.\n\n'Let the blue sky overhead,\nThe green earth on which ye tread,\nAll that must eternal be\nWitness the solemnity.\n\nLXVII.\n\n'From the corners uttermost\nOf the bounds of English coast;\nFrom every hut, village, and town\nWhere those who

for cold\u2014\nLXIX.\n\n'From the haunts of daily life\nWhere is waged the daily strife\nWith common wants and common cares\nWhich sows the human heart with tares\u2014\nLXX.\n\n'Lastly from the palaces\nWhere the murmur of distress\nEchoes, like the distant sound\nOf a wind alive around\nLXXI.\n\n'Those prison halls of wealth and fashion,\nWhere some few feel such compassion\nFor those who

gold\u2014\nLXXIII.\n\n'Let a vast assembly be,\nAnd with great solemnity\nDeclare with measured words that ye\nAre, as God has made ye, free\u2014\nLXXIV.\n\n'Be your strong and simple words\nKeen to wound as sharpened swords,\nAnd wide as targes let them be,\nWith their shade to cover ye.\n\nLXXV.\n\n'Let the tyrants pour around\nWith a quick and startling sound,\nLike the loosening of a sea,\nTroops of armed emblazonry.\n\nLXXVI.\n\n'Let the charged artillery drive\nTill the dead air seems alive\nWith the clash of clanging wheels,\nAnd the tramp of horses' heels.\n\nLXXVII.\n\n'Let the fix\u00e8d bayonet\nGleam with sharp desire to wet\nIts bright point in English blood\nLooking keen as one for food.\n\nLXXVIII.\n\n'Let the horsemen's scimitars\nWheel and flash, like sphereless stars\nThirsting to eclipse their burning\nIn a sea of death and mourning.\n\nLXXIX.\n\n'Stand ye calm and resolute,\nLike a forest close and mute,\nWith folded arms and looks which are\nWeapons of unvanquished war,\nLXXX.\n\n'And let Panic, who outspeeds\nThe career of arm\u00e8d steeds\nPass, a disregarded shade\nThrough your phalanx undismayed.\n\nLXXXI.\n\n'Let the laws of your own land,\nGood or ill, between ye stand\nHand to hand, and foot to foot,\nArbiters of the dispute,\nLXXXII.\n\n'The old laws of England\u2014they\nWhose reverend heads with age are gray,\nChildren of a wiser day;\nAnd whose solemn voice must be\nThine own echo\u2014Liberty!\nLXXXIII.\n\n'On those who first should violate\nSuch sacred heralds in their state\nRest the blood that must ensue,\nAnd it will not rest on you.\n\nLXXXIV.\n\n'And if then the tyrants dare\nLet them ride among you there,\nSlash, and stab, and maim, and hew,\u2014\nWhat they like, that let them do.\n\nLXXXV.\n\n'With folded arms and steady eyes,\nAnd little fear, and less surprise,\nLook upon them as they slay\nTill their rage has died away.\n\nLXXXVI.\n\n'Then they will return with shame\nTo the place from which they came,\nAnd the blood thus shed will speak\nIn hot blushes on their cheek.\n\nLXXXVII.\n\n'Every woman in the land\nWill point at them as they stand\u2014\nThey will hardly dare to greet\nTheir acquaintance in the street.\n\nLXXXVIII.\n\n'And the bold, true warriors\nWho have hugged Danger in wars\nWill turn to those who would be free,\nAshamed of such base company.\n\n'And that slaughter to the Nation\nShall steam up like inspiration,\nEloquent, oracular;\nA volcano heard afar.\n\nLXXXIX.\n\n'And these words shall then become\nLike Oppression's thundered doom\nRinging through each heart and brain,\nHeard again\u2014again\u2014again\u2014\nXC.\n\n'Rise like Lions after slumber\nIn unvanquishable number\u2014\nShake your chains to earth like dew\nWhich in sleep had fallen on

Sister of that orphan one,\nWhose empire is the name thou weepest on,\nIn my heart's temple I suspend to thee\nThese votive wreaths of withered memory.\n\nPoor captive bird! who, from thy narrow cage,\nPourest such music, that it might assuage\nThe rugg\u00e8d hearts of those who prisoned thee,\nWere they not deaf to all sweet melody;\nThis song shall be thy rose: its petals pale\nAre dead, indeed, my adored Nightingale!\nBut soft and fragrant is the faded blossom,\nAnd it has no thorn left to wound thy bosom.\n\nHigh, spirit-wing\u00e8d Heart! who dost for ever\nBeat thine unfeeling bars with vain endeavour,\nTill those bright plumes of thought, in which arrayed\nIt over-soared this low and worldly shade,\nLie shattered; and thy panting, wounded breast\nStains with dear blood its unmaternal nest!\nI weep vain tears: blood would less bitter be,\nYet poured forth gladlier, could it profit thee.\n\nSeraph of Heaven! too gentle to be human,\nVeiling beneath that radiant form of Woman\nAll that is insupportable in thee\nOf light, and love, and immortality!\nSweet Benediction in the eternal Curse!\nVeiled Glory of this lampless Universe!\nThou Moon beyond the clouds! Thou living Form\nAmong the Dead! Thou Star above the Storm!\nThou Wonder, and thou Beauty, and thou Terror!\nThou Harmony of Nature's art! Thou Mirror\nIn whom, as in the splendour of the Sun,\nAll shapes look glorious which thou gazest on!\nAy, even the dim words which obscure thee now\nFlash, lightning-like, with unaccustomed glow;\nI pray thee that thou blot from this sad song\nAll of its much mortality and wrong,\nWith those clear drops, which start like sacred dew\nFrom the twin lights thy sweet soul darkens through,\nWeeping, till sorrow becomes ecstasy:\nThen smile on it, so that it may not die.\n\nI never thought before my death to see\nYouth's vision thus made perfect.\n\nEmily,\nI love thee; though the world by no thin name\nWill hide that love from its unvalued shame.\n\nWould we two had been twins of the same mother!\nOr, that the name my heart lent to another\nCould be a sister's bond for her and thee,\nBlending two beams of one eternity!\nYet were one lawful and the other true,\nThese names, though dear, could paint not, as is due,\nHow beyond refuge I am thine.\n\nAh me!\nI am not thine: I am a part of thee.\n\nSweet Lamp! my moth-like Muse has burned its wings\nOr, like a dying swan who soars and sings,\nYoung Love should teach Time, in his own gray style,\nAll that thou art.\n\nArt thou not void of guile,\nA lovely soul formed to be blessed and bless?\n\nA well of sealed and secret happiness,\nWhose waters like blithe light and music are,\nVanquishing dissonance and gloom?\n\nA Star\nWhich moves not in the moving heavens, alone?\n\nA Smile amid dark frowns?\n\na gentle tone\nAmid rude voices?\n\na belov\u00e8d light?\n\nA Solitude, a Refuge, a Delight?\n\nA Lute, which those whom Love has taught to play\nMake music on, to soothe the roughest day\nAnd lull fond Grief asleep?\n\na buried treasure?\n\nA cradle of young thoughts of wingless pleasure?\n\nA violet-shrouded grave of Woe?\n\n\u2014I measure\nThe world of fancies, seeking one like thee,\nAnd find\u2014alas! mine own infirmity.\n\nShe met me, Stranger, upon life's rough way,\nAnd lured me towards sweet Death; as Night by Day,\nWinter by Spring, or Sorrow by swift Hope,\nLed into light, life, peace.\n\nAn antelope,\nIn the suspended impulse of its lightness,\nWere less aethereally light: the brightness\nOf her divinest presence trembles through\nHer limbs, as underneath a cloud of dew\nEmbodied in the windless heaven of June\nAmid the splendour-wing\u00e8d stars, the Moon\nBurns, inextinguishably beautiful:\nAnd from her lips, as from a hyacinth full\nOf honey-dew, a liquid murmur drops,\nKilling the sense with passion; sweet as stops\nOf planetary music heard in trance.\n\nIn her mild lights the starry spirits dance,\nThe sunbeams of those wells which ever leap\nUnder the lightnings of the soul\u2014too deep\nFor the brief fathom-line of thought or sense.\n\nThe glory of her being, issuing thence,\nStains the dead, blank, cold air with a warm shade\nOf unentangled intermixture, made\nBy Love, of light and motion: one intense\nDiffusion, one serene Omnipresence,\nWhose flowing outlines mingle in their flowing,\nAround her cheeks and utmost fingers glowing\nWith the unintermitted blood, which there\nQuivers, (as in a fleece of snow-like air\nThe crimson pulse of living morning quiver,)\nContinuously prolonged, and ending never,\nTill they are lost, and in that Beauty furled\nWhich penetrates and clasps and fills the world;\nScarce visible from extreme loveliness.\n\nWarm fragrance seems to fall from her light dress\nAnd her loose hair; and where some heavy tress\nThe air of her own speed has disentwined,\nThe sweetness seems to satiate the faint wind;\nAnd in the soul a wild odour is felt,\nBeyond the sense, like fiery dews that melt\nInto the bosom of a frozen bud.\n\nSee where she stands! a mortal shape indued\nWith love and life and light and deity,\nAnd motion which may change but cannot die;\nAn image of some bright Eternity;\nA shadow of some golden dream; a Splendour\nLeaving the third sphere pilotless; a tender\nReflection of the eternal Moon of Love\nUnder whose motions life's dull billows move;\nA Metaphor of Spring and Youth and Morning;\nA Vision like incarnate April, warning,\nWith smiles and tears, Frost the Anatomy\nInto his summer grave.\n\nAh, woe is me!\nWhat have I dared?\n\nwhere am I lifted?\n\nhow\nShall I descend, and perish not?\n\nI know\nThat Love makes all things equal: I have heard\nBy mine own heart this joyous truth averred:\nThe spirit of the worm beneath the sod\nIn love and worship, blends itself with God.\n\nSpouse! Sister! Angel! Pilot of the Fate\nWhose course has been so starless! O too late\nBelov\u00e8d! O too soon adored, by me!\nFor in the fields of Immortality\nMy spirit should at first have worshipped thine,\nA divine presence in a place divine;\nOr should have moved beside it on this earth,\nA shadow of that substance, from its birth;\nBut not as now:\u2014I love thee; yes, I feel\nThat on the fountain of my heart a seal\nIs set, to keep its waters pure and bright\nFor thee, since in those tears thou hast delight.\n\nWe\u2014are we not formed, as notes of music are,\nFor one another, though dissimilar;\nSuch difference without discord, as can make\nThose sweetest sounds, in which all spirits shake\nAs trembling leaves in a continuous air?\n\nThy wisdom speaks in me, and bids me dare\nBeacon the rocks on which high hearts are wrecked.\n\nI never was attached to that great sect,\nWhose doctrine is, that each one should select\nOut of the crowd a mistress or a friend,\nAnd all the rest, though fair and wise, commend\nTo cold oblivion, though it is in the code\nOf modern morals, and the beaten road\nWhich those poor slaves with weary footsteps tread,\nWho travel to their home among the dead\nBy the broad highway of the world, and so\nWith one chained friend, perhaps a jealous foe,\nThe dreariest and the longest journey go.\n\nTrue Love in this differs from gold and clay,\nThat to divide is not to take away.\n\nLove is like understanding, that grows bright,\nGazing on many truths; 'tis like thy light,\nImagination! which from earth and sky,\nAnd from the depths of human fantasy,\nAs from a thousand prisms and mirrors, fills\nThe Universe with glorious beams, and kills\nError, the worm, with many a sun-like arrow\nOf its reverberated lightning.\n\nNarrow\nThe heart that loves, the brain that contemplates,\nThe life that wears, the spirit that creates\nOne object, and one form, and builds thereby\nA sepulchre for its eternity.\n\nMind from its object differs most in this:\nEvil from good; misery from happiness;\nThe baser from the nobler; the impure\nAnd frail, from what is clear and must endure.\n\nIf you divide suffering and dross, you may\nDiminish till it is consumed away;\nIf you divide pleasure and love and thought,\nEach part exceeds the whole; and we know not\nHow much, while any yet remains unshared,\nOf pleasure may be gained, of sorrow spared:\nThis truth is that deep well, whence sages draw\nThe unenvied light of hope; the eternal law\nBy which those live, to whom this world of life\nIs as a garden ravaged, and whose strife\nTills for the promise of a later birth\nThe wilderness of this Elysian earth.\n\nThere was a Being whom my spirit oft\nMet on its visioned wanderings, far aloft,\nIn the clear golden prime of my youth's dawn,\nUpon the fairy isles of sunny lawn,\nAmid the enchanted mountains, and the caves\nOf divine sleep, and on the air-like waves\nOf wonder-level dream, whose tremulous floor\nPaved her light steps;\u2014on an imagined shore,\nUnder the gray beak of some promontory\nShe met me, robed in such exceeding glory,\nThat I beheld her not.\n\nIn solitudes\nHer voice came to me through the whispering woods,\nAnd from the fountains, and the odours deep\nOf flowers, which, like lips murmuring in their sleep\nOf the sweet kisses which had lulled them there,\nBreathed but of her to the enamoured air;\nAnd from the breezes whether low or loud,\nAnd from the rain of every passing cloud,\nAnd from the singing of the summer-birds,\nAnd from all sounds, all silence.\n\nIn the words\nOf antique verse and high romance, -- in form,\nSound, colour -- in whatever checks that Storm\nWhich with the shattered present chokes the past;\nAnd in that best philosophy, whose taste\nMakes this cold common hell, our life, a doom\nAs glorious as a fiery martyrdom;\nHer Spirit was the harmony of truth.\n\nThen, from the caverns of my dreamy youth\nI sprang, as one sandalled with plumes of fire,\nAnd towards the lodestar of my one desire,\nI flitted, like a dizzy moth, whose flight\nIs as a dead leaf's in the owlet light,\nWhen it would seek in Hesper's setting sphere\nA radiant death, a fiery sepulchre,\nAs if it were a lamp of earthly flame.\n\nBut She, whom prayers or tears then could not tame,\nPassed, like a God throned on a wing\u00e8d planet,\nWhose burning plumes to tenfold swiftness fan it,\nInto the dreary cone of our life's shade;\nAnd as a man with mighty loss dismayed,\nI would have followed, though the grave between\nYawned like a gulf whose spectres are unseen:\nWhen a voice said:--'O thou of hearts the weakest,\nThe phantom is beside thee whom thou seekest.\n\nThen I\u2014'Where?\n\n'--the world's echo answered 'where?\n\nAnd in that silence, and in my despair,\nI questioned every tongueless wind that flew\nOver my tower of mourning, if it knew\nWhither 'twas fled, this soul out of my soul;\nAnd murmured names and spells which have control\nOver the sightless tyrants of our fate;\nBut neither prayer nor verse could dissipate\nThe night which closed on her; nor uncreate\nThat world within this Chaos, mine and me,\nOf which she was the veiled Divinity,\nThe world I say of thoughts that worshipped her:\nAnd therefore I went forth, with hope and fear\nAnd every gentle passion sick to death,\nFeeding my course with expectation's breath,\nInto the wintry forest of our life;\nAnd struggling through its error with vain strife,\nAnd stumbling in my weakness and my haste,\nAnd half bewildered by new forms, I passed,\nSeeking among those untaught foresters\nIf I could find one form resembling hers,\nIn which she might have masked herself from me.\n\nThere,\u2014One, whose voice was venomed melody\nSate by a well, under blue nightshade bowers;\nThe breath of her false mouth was like faint flowers,\nHer touch was as electric poison,\u2014flame\nOut of her looks into my vitals came,\nAnd from her living cheeks and bosom flew\nA killing air, which pierced like honey-dew\nInto the core of my green heart, and lay\nUpon its leaves; until, as hair grown gray\nO'er a young brow, they hid its unblown prime\nWith ruins of unseasonable time.\n\nIn many mortal forms I rashly sought\nThe shadow of that idol of my thought.\n\nAnd some were fair\u2014but beauty dies away:\nOthers were wise\u2014but honeyed words betray:\nAnd One was true\u2014oh! why not true to me?\n\nThen, as a hunted deer that could not flee,\nI turned upon my thoughts, and stood at bay,\nWounded and weak and panting; the cold day\nTrembled, for pity of my strife and pain.\n\nWhen, like a noonday dawn, there shone again\nDeliverance.\n\nOne stood on my path who seemed\nAs like the glorious shape which I had dreamed\nAs is the Moon, whose changes ever run\nInto themselves, to the eternal Sun;\nThe cold chaste Moon, the Queen of Heaven's bright isles,\nWho makes all beautiful on which she smiles,\nThat wandering shrine of soft yet icy flame\nWhich ever is transformed, yet still the same,\nAnd warms not but illumines.\n\nYoung and fair\nAs the descended Spirit of that sphere,\nShe hid me, as the Moon may hide the night\nFrom its own darkness, until all was bright\nBetween the Heaven and Earth of my calm mind,\nAnd, as a cloud charioted by the wind,\nShe led me to a cave in that wild place,\nAnd sate beside me, with her downward face\nIllumining my slumbers, like the Moon\nWaxing and waning o'er Endymion.\n\nAnd I was laid asleep, spirit and limb,\nAnd all my being became bright or dim\nAs the Moon's image in a summer sea,\nAccording as she smiled or frowned on me;\nAnd there I lay, within a chaste cold bed:\nAlas, I then was nor alive nor dead:\u2014\nFor at her silver voice came Death and Life,\nUnmindful each of their accustomed strife,\nMasked like twin babes, a sister and a brother,\nThe wandering hopes of one abandoned mother,\nAnd through the cavern without wings they flew,\nAnd cried 'Away, he is not of our crew.\n\nI wept, and though it be a dream, I weep.\n\nWhat storms then shook the ocean of my sleep,\nBlotting that Moon, whose pale and waning lips\nThen shrank as in the sickness of eclipse;\u2014\nAnd how my soul was as a lampless sea,\nAnd who was then its Tempest; and when She,\nThe Planet of that hour, was quenched, what frost\nCrept o'er those waters, till from coast to coast\nThe moving billows of my being fell\nInto a death of ice, immovable;\u2014\nAnd then\u2014what earthquakes made it gape and split,\nThe white Moon smiling all the while on it,\nThese words conceal:\u2014If not, each word would be\nThe key of staunchless tears.\n\nWeep not for me!\nAt length, into the obscure Forest came\nThe Vision I had sought through grief and shame.\n\nAthwart that wintry wilderness of thorns\nFlashed from her motion splendour like the Morn's,\nAnd from her presence life was radiated\nThrough the gray earth and branches bare and dead;\nSo that her way was paved, and roofed above\nWith flowers as soft as thoughts of budding love;\nAnd music from her respiration spread\nLike light,\u2014all other sounds were penetrated\nBy the small, still, sweet spirit of that sound,\nSo that the savage winds hung mute around;\nAnd odours warm and fresh fell from her hair\nDissolving the dull cold in the frore air:\nSoft as an Incarnation of the Sun,\nWhen light is changed to love, this glorious One\nFloated into the cavern where I lay,\nAnd called my Spirit, and the dreaming clay\nWas lifted by the thing that dreamed below\nAs smoke by fire, and in her beauty's glow\nI stood, and felt the dawn of my long night\nWas penetrating me with living light:\nI knew it was the Vision veiled from me\nSo many years -- that it was Emily.\n\nTwin Spheres of light who rule this passive Earth,\nThis world of love, this me; and into birth\nAwaken all its fruits and flowers, and dart\nMagnetic might into its central heart;\nAnd lift its billows and its mists, and guide\nBy everlasting laws, each wind and tide\nTo its fit cloud, and its appointed cave;\nAnd lull its storms, each in the craggy grave\nWhich was its cradle, luring to faint bowers\nThe armies of the rainbow-wing\u00e8d showers;\nAnd, as those married lights, which from the towers\nOf Heaven look forth and fold the wandering globe\nIn liquid sleep and splendour, as a robe;\nAnd all their many-mingled influence blend,\nIf equal, yet unlike, to one sweet end;\u2014\nSo ye, bright regents, with alternate sway\nGovern my sphere of being, night and day!\nThou, not disdaining even a borrowed might;\nThou, not eclipsing a remoter light;\nAnd, through the shadow of the seasons three,\nFrom Spring to Autumn's sere maturity,\nLight it into the Winter of the tomb,\nWhere it may ripen to a brighter bloom.\n\nThou too, O Comet beautiful and fierce,\nWho drew the heart of this frail Universe\nTowards thine own; till, wrecked in that convulsion,\nAlternating attraction and repulsion,\nThine went astray and that was rent in twain;\nOh, float into our azure heaven again!\nBe there Love's folding-star at thy return;\nThe living Sun will feed thee from its urn\nOf golden fire; the Moon will veil her horn\nIn thy last smiles; adoring Even and Morn\nWill worship thee with incense of calm breath\nAnd lights and shadows; as the star of Death\nAnd Birth is worshipped by those sisters wild\nCalled Hope and Fear\u2014upon the heart are piled\nTheir offerings,\u2014of this sacrifice divine\nA World shall be the altar.\n\nLady mine,\nScorn not these flowers of thought, the fading birth\nWhich from its heart of hearts that plant puts forth\nWhose fruit, made perfect by thy sunny eyes,\nWill be as of the trees of Paradise.\n\nThe day is come, and thou wilt fly with me.\n\nTo whatsoe'er of dull mortality\nIs mine, remain a vestal sister still;\nTo the intense, the deep, the imperishable,\nNot mine but me, henceforth be thou united\nEven as a bride, delighting and delighted.\n\nThe hour is come:\u2014the destined Star has risen\nWhich shall descend upon a vacant prison.\n\nThe walls are high, the gates are strong, thick set\nThe sentinels\u2014but true Love never yet\nWas thus constrained: it overleaps all fence:\nLike lightning, with invisible violence\nPiercing its continents; like Heaven's free breath,\nWhich he who grasps can hold not; liker Death,\nWho rides upon a thought, and makes his way\nThrough temple, tower, and palace, and the array\nOf arms: more strength has Love than he or they;\nFor it can burst his charnel, and make free\nThe limbs in chains, the heart in agony,\nThe soul in dust and chaos.\n\nEmily,\nA ship is floating in the harbour now,\nA wind is hovering o'er the mountain's brow;\nThere is a path on the sea's azure floor,\nNo keel has ever ploughed that path before;\nThe halcyons brood around the foamless isles;\nThe treacherous Ocean has forsworn its wiles;\nThe merry mariners are bold and free:\nSay, my heart's sister, wilt thou sail with me?\n\nOur bark is as an albatross, whose nest\nIs a far Eden of the purple East;\nAnd we between her wings will sit, while Night,\nAnd Day, and Storm, and Calm, pursue their flight,\nOur ministers, along the boundless Sea,\nTreading each other's heels, unheededly.\n\nIt is an isle under Ionian skies,\nBeautiful as a wreck of Paradise,\nAnd, for the harbours are not safe and good,\nThis land would have remained a solitude\nBut for some pastoral people native there,\nWho from the Elysian, clear, and golden air\nDraw the last spirit of the age of gold,\nSimple and spirited; innocent and bold.\n\nThe blue Aegean girds this chosen home,\nWith ever-changing sound and light and foam,\nKissing the sifted sands, and caverns hoar;\nAnd all the winds wandering along the shore\nUndulate with the undulating tide:\nThere are thick woods where sylvan forms abide;\nAnd many a fountain, rivulet, and pond,\nAs clear as elemental diamond,\nOr serene morning air; and far beyond,\nThe mossy tracks made by the goats and deer\n(Which the rough shepherd treads but once a year)\nPierce into glades, caverns, and bowers, and halls\nBuilt round with ivy, which the waterfalls\nIllumining, with sound that never fails\nAccompany the noonday nightingales;\nAnd all the place is peopled with sweet airs;\nThe light clear element which the isle wears\nIs heavy with the scent of lemon-flowers,\nWhich floats like mist laden with unseen showers,\nAnd falls upon the eyelids like faint sleep;\nAnd from the moss violets and jonquils peep,\nAnd dart their arrowy odour through the brain\nTill you might faint with that delicious pain.\n\nAnd every motion, odour, beam, and tone,\nWith that deep music is in unison:\nWhich is a soul within the soul\u2014they seem\nLike echoes of an antenatal dream.\n\nIt is an isle 'twixt Heaven, Air, Earth, and Sea,\nCradled, and hung in clear tranquillity;\nBright as that wandering Eden Lucifer,\nWashed by the soft blue Oceans of young air.\n\nIt is a favoured place.\n\nFamine or Blight,\nPestilence, War and Earthquake, never light\nUpon its mountain-peaks; blind vultures, they\nSail onward far upon their fatal way:\nThe wing\u00e8d storms, chanting their thunder-psalm\nTo other lands, leave azure chasms of calm\nOver this isle, or weep themselves in dew,\nFrom which its fields and woods ever renew\nTheir green and golden immortality.\n\nAnd from the sea there rise, and from the sky\nThere fall, clear exhalations, soft and bright,\nVeil after veil, each hiding some delight,\nWhich Sun or Moon or zephyr draw aside,\nTill the isle's beauty, like a naked bride\nGlowing at once with love and loveliness,\nBlushes and trembles at its own excess:\nYet, like a buried lamp, a Soul no less\nBurns in the heart of this delicious isle,\nAn atom of th'Eternal, whose own smile\nUnfolds itself, and may be felt, not seen\nO'er the gray rocks, blue waves, and forests green,\nFilling their bare and void interstices.\n\nBut the chief marvel of the wilderness\nIs a lone dwelling, built by whom or how\nNone of the rustic island-people know:\n'Tis not a tower of strength, though with its height\nIt overtops the woods; but, for delight,\nSome wise and tender Ocean-King, ere crime\nHad been invented, in the world's young prime,\nReared it, a wonder of that simple time,\nAn envy of the isles, a pleasure-house\nMade sacred to his sister and his spouse.\n\nIt scarce seems now a wreck of human art,\nBut, as it were Titanic; in the heart\nOf Earth having assumed its form, then grown\nOut of the mountains, from the living stone,\nLifting itself in caverns light and high:\nFor all the antique and learn\u00e8d imagery\nHas been erased, and in the place of it\nThe ivy and the wild-vine interknit\nThe volumes of their many-twining stems;\nParasite flowers illume with dewy gems\nThe lampless halls, and when they fade, the sky\nPeeps through their winter-woof of tracery\nWith moonlight patches, or star atoms keen,\nOr fragments of the day's intense serene;\u2014\nWorking mosaic on their Parian floors.\n\nAnd, day and night, aloof, from the high towers\nAnd terraces, the Earth and Ocean seem\nTo sleep in one another's arms, and dream\nOf waves, flowers, clouds, woods, rocks, and all that we\nRead in their smiles, and call reality.\n\nThis isle and house are mine, and I have vowed\nThee to be lady of the solitude.\n\nAnd I have fitted up some chambers there\nLooking towards the golden Eastern air,\nAnd level with the living winds, which flow\nLike waves above the living waves below.\n\nI have sent books and music there, and all\nThose instruments with which high Spirits call\nThe future from its cradle, and the past\nOut of its grave, and make the present last\nIn thoughts and joys which sleep, but cannot die,\nFolded within their own eternity.\n\nOur simple life wants little, and true taste\nHires not the pale drudge Luxury, to waste\nThe scene it would adorn, and therefore still,\nNature with all her children haunts the hill.\n\nThe ring-dove, in the embowering ivy, yet\nKeeps up her love-lament, and the owls flit\nRound the evening tower, and the young stars glance\nBetween the quick bats in their twilight dance;\nThe spotted deer bask in the fresh moonlight\nBefore our gate, and the slow, silent night\nIs measured by the pants of their calm sleep.\n\nBe this our home in life, and when years heap\nTheir withered hours, like leaves, on our decay,\nLet us become the overhanging day,\nThe living soul of this Elysian isle,\nConscious, inseparable, one.\n\nMeanwhile\nWe two will rise, and sit, and walk together,\nUnder the roof of blue Ionian weather,\nAnd wander in the meadows, or ascend\nThe mossy mountains, where the blue heavens bend\nWith lightest winds, to touch their paramour;\nOr linger, where the pebble-paven shore,\nUnder the quick, faint kisses of the sea\nTrembles and sparkles as with ecstasy,\u2014\nPossessing and possessed by all that is\nWithin that calm circumference of bliss,\nAnd by each other, till to love and live\nBe one:\u2014or, at the noontide hour, arrive\nWhere some old cavern hoar seems yet to keep\nThe moonlight of the expired night asleep,\nThrough which the awakened day can never peep;\nA veil for our seclusion, close as night's,\nWhere secure sleep may kill thine innocent lights;\nSleep, the fresh dew of languid love, the rain\nWhose drops quench kisses till they burn again.\n\nAnd we will talk, until thought's melody\nBecome too sweet for utterance, and it die\nIn words, to live again in looks, which dart\nWith thrilling tone into the voiceless heart,\nHarmonizing silence without a sound.\n\nOur breath shall intermix, our bosoms bound,\nAnd our veins beat together; and our lips\nWith other eloquence than words, eclipse\nThe soul that burns between them, and the wells\nWhich boil under our being's inmost cells,\nThe fountains of our deepest life, shall be\nConfused in Passion's golden purity,\nAs mountain-springs under the morning sun.\n\nWe shall become the same, we shall be one\nSpirit within two frames, oh! wherefore two?\n\nOne passion in twin-hearts, which grows and grew,\nTill like two meteors of expanding flame,\nThose spheres instinct with it become the same,\nTouch, mingle, are transfigured; ever still\nBurning, yet ever inconsumable:\nIn one another's substance finding food,\nLike flames too pure and light and unimbued\nTo nourish their bright lives with baser prey,\nWhich point to Heaven and cannot pass away:\nOne hope within two wills, one will beneath\nTwo overshadowing minds, one life, one death,\nOne Heaven, one Hell, one immortality,\nAnd one annihilation.\n\nWoe is me!\nThe wing\u00e8d words on which my soul would pierce\nInto the height of Love's rare Universe,\nAre chains of lead around its flight of fire\u2014\nI pant, I sink, I tremble, I expire!\nWeak Verses, go, kneel at your Sovereign's feet,\nAnd say:\u2014'We are the masters of thy slave;\nWhat wouldest thou with us and ours and thine?\n\nThen call your sisters from Oblivion's cave,\nAll singing loud: 'Love's very pain is sweet,\nBut its reward is in the world divine\nWhich, if not here, it builds beyond the grave.\n\nSo shall ye live when I am there.\n\nThen haste\nOver the hearts of men, until ye meet\nMarina, Vanna, Primus, and the rest,\nAnd bid them love each other and be blessed:\nAnd leave the troop which errs, and which reproves,\nAnd come and be my guest,\u2014for I am Love's.\n\nEpipsychidion was composed at Pisa, Jan.\n\n, Feb.\n\n, 1821, and published without the author's name, in the following summer, by C.\n\n& J.\n\nOllier, London.\n\nThe poem was included by Mrs.\n\nShelley in the Poetical Works, 1839, both edd.\n", "period": "Romantic", "literary_movement": "Romanticism", "register": "Love", "rhetorical_genre": "Epideictic", "discursive_structure": "Monologue", "discourse_type": "Expressive", "narrative_level": "First person", "diegetic_mimetic": "Non-diegetic", "focalization": "First person internal", "person": "First person singular", "deictic_orientation": "Second person", "addressee_type": "Beloved", "deictic_object": "You", "temporal_orientation": "Present", "temporal_structure": "Sequential", "tradition": "British Romanticism", "mode": "Lyric", "genre": "Love poetry", "stanza_structure": "Quatrains", "meter": "Iambic pentameter", "rhyme": "ABAB"}
{"training_idx": 280, "corpus_poem_id": 93495, "title": "The Triumph of Life", "author": "Percy Bysshe Shelley", "year_approx": 1824, "text": "Swift as a spirit hastening to his task\nOf glory & of good, the Sun sprang forth\nRejoicing in his splendour, & the mask\nOf darkness fell from the awakened Earth.\n\nThe smokeless altars of the mountain snows\nFlamed above crimson clouds, & at the birth\nOf light, the Ocean's orison arose\nTo which the birds tempered their matin lay,\nAll flowers in field or forest which unclose\nTheir trembling eyelids to the kiss of day,\nSwinging their censers in the element,\nWith orient incense lit by the new ray\nBurned slow & inconsumably, & sent\nTheir odorous sighs up to the smiling air,\nAnd in succession due, did Continent,\nIsle, Ocean, & all things that in them wear\nThe form & character of mortal mould\nRise as the Sun their father rose, to bear\nTheir portion of the toil which he of old\nTook as his own & then imposed on them;\nBut I, whom thoughts which must remain untold\nHad kept as wakeful as the stars that gem\nThe cone of night, now they were laid asleep,\nStretched my faint limbs beneath the hoary stem\nWhich an old chestnut flung athwart the steep\nOf a green Apennine: before me fled\nThe night; behind me rose the day; the Deep\nWas at my feet, & Heaven above my head\nWhen a strange trance over my fancy grew\nWhich was not slumber, for the shade it spread\nWas so transparent that the scene came through\nAs clear as when a veil of light is drawn\nO'er evening hills they glimmer; and I knew\nThat I had felt the freshness of that dawn,\nBathed in the same cold dew my brow & hair\nAnd sate as thus upon that slope of lawn\nUnder the self same bough, & heard as there\nThe birds, the fountains & the Ocean hold\nSweet talk in music through the enamoured air.\n\nAnd then a Vision on my brain was rolled.\n\nAs in that trance of wondrous thought I lay\nThis was the tenour of my waking dream.\n\nMethought I sate beside a public way\nThick strewn with summer dust, & a great stream\nOf people there was hurrying to & fro\nNumerous as gnats upon the evening gleam,\nAll hastening onward, yet none seemed to know\nWhither he went, or whence he came, or why\nHe made one of the multitude, yet so\nWas borne amid the crowd as through the sky\nOne of the million leaves of summer's bier.\n\nOld age & youth, manhood & infancy,\nMixed in one mighty torrent did appear,\nSome flying from the thing they feared & some\nSeeking the object of another's fear,\nAnd others as with steps towards the tomb\nPored on the trodden worms that crawled beneath,\nAnd others mournfully within the gloom\nOf their own shadow walked, and called it death .\n\n\nAnd some fled from it as it were a ghost,\nHalf fainting in the affliction of vain breath.\n\nBut more with motions which each other crost\nPursued or shunned the shadows the clouds threw\nOr birds within the noonday ether lost,\nUpon that path where flowers never grew;\nAnd weary with vain toil & faint for thirst\nHeard not the fountains whose melodious dew\nOut of their mossy cells forever burst\nNor felt the breeze which from the forest told\nOf grassy paths, & wood lawns interspersed\nWith overarching elms & caverns cold,\nAnd violet banks where sweet dreams brood, but they\nPursued their serious folly as of old .\n\n\nAnd as I gazed methought that in the way\nThe throng grew wilder, as the woods of June\nWhen the South wind shakes the extinguished day.\n\nAnd a cold glare, intenser than the noon\nBut icy cold, obscured with [[blank]] light\nThe Sun as he the stars.\n\nLike the young moon\nWhen on the sunlit limits of the night\nHer white shell trembles amid crimson air\nAnd whilst the sleeping tempest gathers might\nDoth, as a herald of its coming, bear\nThe ghost of her dead Mother, whose dim form\nBends in dark ether from her infant's chair,\nSo came a chariot on the silent storm\nOf its own rushing splendour, and a Shape\nSo sate within as one whom years deform\nBeneath a dusky hood & double cape\nCrouching within the shadow of a tomb,\nAnd o'er what seemed the head, a cloud like crape,\nWas bent a dun & faint etherial gloom\nTempering the light; upon the chariot's beam\nA Janus-visaged Shadow did assume\nThe guidance of that wonder-winged team.\n\nThe Shapes which drew it in thick lightnings\nWere lost: I heard alone on the air's soft stream\nThe music of their ever moving wings.\n\nAll the four faces of that charioteer\nHad their eyes banded .\n\n\nlittle profit brings\nSpeed in the van & blindness in the rear,\nNor then avail the beams that quench the Sun\nOr that his banded eyes could pierce the sphere\nOf all that is, has been, or will be done.\n\nSo ill was the car guided, but it past\nWith solemn speed majestically on .\n\n\nThe crowd gave way, & I arose aghast,\nOr seemed to rise, so mighty was the trance,\nAnd saw like clouds upon the thunder blast\nThe million with fierce song and maniac dance\nRaging around; such seemed the jubilee\nAs when to greet some conqueror's advance\nImperial Rome poured forth her living sea\nFrom senatehouse & prison & theatre\nWhen Freedom left those who upon the free\nHad bound a yoke which soon they stooped to bear.\n\nNor wanted here the true similitude\nOf a triumphal pageant, for where'er\nThe chariot rolled a captive multitude\nWas driven; althose who had grown old in power\nOr misery,\u2014all who have their age subdued,\nBy action or by suffering, and whose hour\nWas drained to its last sand in weal or woe,\nSo that the trunk survived both fruit & flower;\nAll those whose fame or infamy must grow\nTill the great winter lay the form & name\nOf their own earth with them forever low,\nAll but the sacred few who could not tame\nTheir spirits to the Conqueror, but as soon\nAs they had touched the world with living flame\nFled back like eagles to their native noon,\nOf those who put aside the diadem\nOf earthly thrones or gems, till the last one\nWere there;\u2014for they of Athens & Jerusalem\nWere neither mid the mighty captives seen\nNor mid the ribald crowd that followed them\nOr fled before .\n\n\nNow swift, fierce & obscene\nThe wild dance maddens in the van, & those\nWho lead it, fleet as shadows on the green,\nOutspeed the chariot & without repose\nMix with each other in tempestuous measure\nTo savage music .\n\n\nWilder as it grows,\nThey, tortured by the agonizing pleasure,\nConvulsed & on the rapid whirlwinds spun\nOf that fierce spirit, whose unholy leisure\nWas soothed by mischief since the world begun,\nThrow back their heads & loose their streaming hair,\nAnd in their dance round her who dims the Sun\nMaidens & youths fling their wild arms in air\nAs their feet twinkle; they recede, and now\nBending within each other's atmosphere\nKindle invisibly; and as they glow\nLike moths by light attracted & repelled,\nOft to new bright destruction come & go.\n\nTill like two clouds into one vale impelled\nThat shake the mountains when their lightnings mingle\nAnd die in rain,\u2014the fiery band which held\nTheir natures, snaps .\n\n\nere the shock cease to tingle\nOne falls and then another in the path\nSenseless, nor is the desolation single,\nYet ere I can saywherethe chariot hath\nPast over them; nor other trace I find\nBut as of foam after the Ocean's wrath\nIs spent upon the desert shore.\n\n\u2014Behind,\nOld men, and women foully disarrayed\nShake their grey hair in the insulting wind,\nLimp in the dance & strain, with limbs decayed,\nSeeking to reach the light which leaves them still\nFarther behind & deeper in the shade.\n\nBut not the less with impotence of will\nThey wheel, though ghastly shadows interpose\nRound them & round each other, and fulfill\nTheir work and to the dust whence they arose\nSink & corruption veils them as they lie\nAnd frost in these performs what fire in those.\n\nStruck to the heart by this sad pageantry,\nHalf to myself I said, \"And what is this?\n\nWhose shape is that within the car?\n\n& why\"-\nI would have added\u2014\"is all here amiss?\n\nBut a voice answered .\n\n\n\"Life\" .\n\n\nI turned & knew\n(O Heaven have mercy on such wretchedness!)\nThat what I thought was an old root which grew\nTo strange distortion out of the hill side\nWas indeed one of that deluded crew,\nAnd that the grass which methought hung so wide\nAnd white, was but his thin discoloured hair,\nAnd that the holes it vainly sought to hide\nWere or had been eyes.\n\n\u2014\"lf thou canst forbear\nTo join the dance, which I had well forborne,\"\nSaid the grim Feature, of my thought aware,\n\"I will now tell that which to this deep scorn\nLed me & my companions, and relate\nThe progress of the pageant since the morn;\n\"If thirst of knowledge doth not thus abate,\nFollow it even to the night, but I\nAm weary\" .\n\n\nThen like one who with the weight\nOf his own words is staggered, wearily\nHe paused, and ere he could resume, I cried,\n\"First who art thou?\n\n\" .\n\n\n\"Before thy memory\n\"I feared, loved, hated, suffered, did, & died,\nAnd if the spark with which Heaven lit my spirit\nEarth had with purer nutriment supplied\n\"Corruption would not now thus much inherit\nOf what was once Rousseau\u2014nor this disguise\nStained that within which still disdains to wear it.\n\n\"If I have been extinguished, yet there rise\nA thousand beacons from the spark I bore.\n\n\"And who are those chained to the car?\n\n\" \"The Wise,\n\"The great, the unforgotten: they who wore\nMitres & helms & crowns, or wreathes of light,\nSigns of thought's empire over thought; their lore\n\"Taught them not this\u2014to know themselves; their might\nCould not repress the mutiny within,\nAnd for the morn of truth they feigned, deep night\n\"Caught them ere evening.\n\n\" \"Who is he with chin\nUpon his breast and hands crost on his chain?\n\n\"The Child of a fierce hour; he sought to win\n\"The world, and lost all it did contain\nOf greatness, in its hope destroyed; & more\nOf fame & peace than Virtue's self can gain\n\"Without the opportunity which bore\nHim on its eagle's pinion to the peak\nFrom which a thousand climbers have before\n\"Fall'n as Napoleon fell.\n\n\"\u2014I felt my cheek\nAlter to see the great form pass away\nWhose grasp had left the giant world so weak\nThat every pigmy kicked it as it lay\u2014\nAnd much I grieved to think how power & will\nIn opposition rule our mortal day\u2014\nAnd why God made irreconcilable\nGood & the means of good; and for despair\nI half disdained mine eye's desire to fill\nWith the spent vision of the times that were\nAnd scarce have ceased to be .\n\n\n\"Dost thou behold,\"\nSaid then my guide, \"those spoilers spoiled, Voltaire,\n\"Frederic, & Kant, Catherine, & Leopold,\nChained hoary anarch, demagogue & sage\nWhose name the fresh world thinks already old\u2014\n\"For in the battle Life & they did wage\nShe remained conqueror\u2014I was overcome\nBy my own heart alone, which neither age\n\"Nor tears nor infamy nor now the tomb\nCould temper to its object.\n\n\"\u2014\"Let them pass\"\u2014\nI cried\u2014\"the world & its mysterious doom\n\"Is not so much more glorious than it was\nThat I desire to worship those who drew\nNew figures on its false & fragile glass\n\"As the old faded.\n\n\"\u2014\"Figures ever new\nRise on the bubble, paint them how you may;\nWe have but thrown, as those before us threw,\n\"Our shadows on it as it past away.\n\nBut mark, how chained to the triumphal chair\nThe mighty phantoms of an elder day\u2014\n\"All that is mortal of great Plato there\nExpiates the joy & woe his master knew not;\nThat star that ruled his doom was far too fair\u2014\n\"And Life, where long that flower of Heaven grew not,\nConquered the heart by love which gold or pain\nOr age or sloth or slavery could subdue not\u2014\n\"And near [[blank]] walk the [[blank]] twain,\nThe tutor & his pupil, whom Dominion\nFollowed as tame as vulture in a chain.\n\n\"The world was darkened beneath either pinion\nOf him whom from the flock of conquerors\nFame

learn\nFrom thee.\n\n\u2014Now listen .\n\n\nIn the April prime\nWhen all the forest tops began to burn\n\"With kindling green, touched by the azure clime\nOf the young year, I found myself asleep\nUnder a mountain which from unknown time\n\"Had yawned into a cavern high & deep,\nAnd from it came a gentle rivulet\nWhose water like clear air in its calm sweep\n\"Bent the soft grass & kept for ever wet\nThe stems of the sweet flowers, and filled the grove\nWith sound which all who hear must needs forget\n\"All pleasure & all pain, all hate & love,\nWhich they had known before that hour of rest:\nA sleeping mother then would dream not of\n\"The only child who died upon her breast\nAt eventide, a king would mourn no more\nThe crown of which his brow was dispossest\n\"When the sun lingered o'er the Ocean floor\nTo gild his rival's new prosperity.\n\nThou wouldst forget thus vainly to deplore\n\"Ills, which if ills, can find no cure from thee,\nThe thought of which no other sleep will quell\nNor other music blot from memory\u2014\n\"So sweet & deep is the oblivious spell.\n\nWhether my life had been before that sleep\nThe Heaven which I imagine, or a Hell\n\"Like this harsh world in which I wake to weep,\nI know not.\n\nI arose & for a space\nThe scene of woods & waters seemed to keep,\n\"Though it was now broad day, a gentle trace\nOf light diviner than the common Sun\nSheds on the common Earth, but all the place\n\"Was filled with many sounds woven into one\nOblivious melody, confusing sense\nAmid the gliding waves & shadows dun;\n\"And as I looked the bright omnipresence\nOf morning through the orient cavern flowed,\nAnd the Sun's image radiantly intense\n\"Burned on the waters of the well that glowed\nLike gold, and threaded all the forest maze\nWith winding paths of emerald fire\u2014there stood\n\"Amid the sun, as he amid the blaze\nOf his own glory, on the vibrating\nFloor of the fountain, paved with flashing rays,\n\"A shape all light, which with one hand did fling\nDew on the earth, as if she were the Dawn\nWhose invisible rain forever seemed to sing\n\"A silver music on the mossy lawn,\nAnd still before her on the dusky grass\nIris her many coloured scarf had drawn.\n\n\"In her right hand she bore a crystal glass\nMantling with bright Nepenthe;\u2014the fierce splendour\nFell from her as she moved under the mass\n\"Of the deep cavern, & with palms so tender\nTheir tread broke not the mirror of its billow,\nGlided along the river, and did bend her\n\"Head under the dark boughs, till like a willow\nHer fair hair swept the bosom of the stream\nThat whispered with delight to be their pillow.\n\n\"As one enamoured is upborne in dream\nO'er lily-paven lakes mid silver mist\nTo wondrous music, so this shape might seem\n\"Partly to tread the waves with feet which kist\nThe dancing foam, partly to glide along\nThe airs that roughened the moist amethyst,\n\"Or the slant morning beams that fell among\nThe trees, or the soft shadows of the trees;\nAnd her feet ever to the ceaseless song\n\"Of leaves & winds & waves & birds & bees\nAnd falling drops moved in a measure new\nYet sweet, as on the summer evening breeze\n\"Up from the lake a shape of golden dew\nBetween two rocks, athwart the rising moon,\nMoves up the east, where eagle never flew.\n\n\"And still her feet, no less than the sweet tune\nTo which they moved, seemed as they moved, to blot\nThe thoughts of him who gazed on them, & soon\n\"All that was seemed as if it had been not,\nAs if the gazer's mind was strewn beneath\nHer feet like embers, & she, thought by thought,\n\"Trampled its fires into the dust of death,\nAs Day upon the threshold of the east\nTreads out the lamps of night, until the breath\n\"Of darkness reillumines even the least\nOf heaven's living eyes\u2014like day she came,\nMaking the night a dream; and ere she ceased\n\"To move, as one between desire and shame\nSuspended, I said\u2014'If, as it doth seem,\nThou comest from the realm without a name,\n\" 'Into this valley of perpetual dream,\nShew whence I came, and where I am, and why\u2014\nPass not away upon the passing stream.\n\n\" 'Arise and quench thy thirst,' was her reply,\nAnd as a shut lily, stricken by the wand\nOf dewy morning's vital alchemy,\n\"I rose; and, bending at her sweet command,\nTouched with faint lips the cup she raised,\nAnd suddenly my brain became as sand\n\"Where the first wave had more than half erased\nThe track of deer on desert Labrador,\nWhilst the fierce wolf from which they fled amazed\n\"Leaves his stamp visibly upon the shore\nUntil the second bursts\u2014so on my sight\nBurst a new Vision never seen before.\n\n\"And the fair shape waned in the coming light\nAs veil by veil the silent splendour drops\nFrom Lucifer, amid the chrysolite\n\"Of sunrise ere it strike the mountain tops\u2014\nAnd as the presence of that fairest planet\nAlthough unseen is felt by one who hopes\n\"That his day's path may end as he began it\nIn that star's smile, whose light is like the scent\nOf a jonquil when evening breezes fan it,\n\"Or the soft note in which his dear lament\nThe Brescian shepherd breathes, or the caress\nThat turned his weary slumber to content.\n\n\"So knew I in that light's severe excess\nThe presence of that shape which on the stream\nMoved, as I moved along the wilderness,\n\"More dimly than a day appearing dream,\nThe ghost of a forgotten form of sleep\nA light from Heaven whose half extinguished beam\n\"Through the sick day in which we wake to weep\nGlimmers, forever sought, forever lost.\n\nSo did that shape its obscure tenour keep\n\"Beside my path, as silent as a ghost;\nBut the new Vision, and its cold bright car,\nWith savage music, stunning music, crost\n\"The forest, and as if from some dread war\nTriumphantly returning, the loud million\nFiercely extolled the fortune of her star.\n\n\"A moving arch of victory the vermilion\nAnd green & azure plumes of Iris had\nBuilt high over her wind-winged pavilion,\n\"And underneath aetherial glory clad\nThe wilderness, and far before her flew\nThe tempest of the splendour which forbade\nShadow to fall from leaf or stone;\u2014the crew\nSeemed in that light like atomies that dance\nWithin a sunbeam.\n\n\u2014Some upon the new\n\"Embroidery of flowers that did enhance\nThe grassy vesture of the desart, played,\nForgetful of the chariot's swift advance;\n\"Others stood gazing till within the shade\nOf the great mountain its light left them dim.\n\nOthers outspeeded it, and others made\n\"Circles around it like the clouds that swim\nRound the high moon in a bright sea of air,\nAnd more did follow, with exulting hymn,\n\"The chariot & the captives fettered there,\nBut all like bubbles on an eddying flood\nFell into the same track at last & were\n\"Borne onward.\n\n\u2014I among the multitude\nWas swept; me sweetest flowers delayed not long,\nMe not the shadow nor the solitude,\n\"Me not the falling stream's Lethean song,\nMe, not the phantom of that early form\nWhich moved upon its motion,\u2014but among\n\"The thickest billows of the living storm\nI plunged, and bared my bosom to the clime\nOf that cold light, whose airs too soon deform.\n\n\"Before the chariot had begun to climb\nThe opposing steep of that mysterious dell,\nBehold a wonder worthy of the rhyme\n\"Of him whom from the lowest depths of Hell\nThrough every Paradise & through all glory\nLove led serene, & who returned to tell\n\"In words of hate & awe the wondrous story\nHow all things are transfigured, except Love;\nFor deaf as is a sea which wrath makes hoary\n\"The world can hear not the sweet notes that move\nThe sphere whose light is melody to lovers\u2014-\nA wonder worthy of his rhyme\u2014the grove\n\"Grew dense with shadows to its inmost covers,\nThe earth was grey with phantoms, & the air\nWas peopled with dim forms, as when there hovers\n\"A flock of vampire-bats before the glare\nOf the tropic sun, bring ere evening\nStrange night upon some Indian isle,\u2014thus were\n\"Phantoms diffused around, & some did fling\nShadows of shadows, yet unlike themselves,\nBehind them, some like eaglets on the wing\n\"Were lost in the white blaze, others like elves\nDanced in a thousand unimagined shapes\nUpon the sunny streams & grassy shelves;\n\"And others sate chattering like restless apes\nOn vulgar paws and voluble like fire.\n\nSome made a cradle of the ermined capes\n\"Of kingly mantles, some upon the tiar\nOf pontiffs sate like vultures, others played\nWithin the crown which girt with empire\n\"A baby's or an idiot's brow, & made\nTheir nests in it; the old anatomies\nSate hatching their bare brood under the shade\n\"Of demon wings, and laughed from their dead eyes\nTo reassume the delegated power\nArrayed in which these worms did monarchize\n\"Who make this earth their charnel.\n\n\u2014Others more\nHumble, like falcons sate upon the fist\nOf common men, and round their heads did soar,\n\"Or like small gnats & flies, as thick as mist\nOn evening marshes, thronged about the brow\nOf lawyer, statesman, priest & theorist,\n\"And others like discoloured flakes of snow\nOn fairest bosoms & the sunniest hair\nFell, and were melted by the youthful glow\n\"Which they extinguished; for like tears, they were\nA veil to those from whose faint lids they rained\nIn drops of sorrow.\n\n\u2014I became aware\n\"Of whence those forms proceeded which thus stained\nThe track in which we moved; after brief space\nFrom every form the beauty slowly waned,\n\"From every firmest limb & fairest face\nThe strength & freshness fell like dust, & left\nThe action & the shape without the grace\n\"Of life; the marble brow of youth was cleft\nWith care, and in the eyes where once hope shone\nDesire like a lioness bereft\n\"Of its last cub, glared ere it died; each one\nOf that great crowd sent forth incessantly\nThese shadows, numerous as the dead leaves blown\n\"In Autumn evening from a popular tree\u2014\nEach, like himself & like each other were,\nAt first, but soon distorted, seemed to be\n\"Obscure clouds moulded by the casual air;\nAnd of this stuff the car's creative ray\nWrought all the busy phantoms that were there\n\"As the sun shapes the clouds\u2014thus, on the way\nMask after mask fell from the countenance\nAnd form of all, and long before the day\n\"Was old, the joy which waked like Heaven's glance\nThe sleepers in the oblivious valley, died,\nAnd some grew weary of the ghastly dance\n\"And fell, as I have fallen by the way side,\nThose soonest from whose forms most shadows past\nAnd least of strength & beauty did abide.\n\n\"Then, what is Life?\n\n\" I said .\n\n\nthe cripple cast\nHis eye upon the car which now had rolled\nOnward, as if that look must be the last,\nAnd answered .\n\n\n\"Happy those for whom the fold\nOf .\n", "period": "Romantic", "literary_movement":

in sooth he was a shameless wight,\nSore given to revel and ungodly glee;\nFew earthly things found favour in his sight\nSave concubines and carnal companie,\nAnd flaunting wassailers of high and low degree.\n\nIII.\n\nChilde Harold was he hight: --but whence his name\nAnd lineage long, it suits me not to say;\nSuffice it, that perchance they were of fame,\nAnd had been glorious in another day:\nBut one sad losel soils a name for aye,\nHowever mighty in the olden time;\nNor all that heralds rake from coffined clay,\nNor florid prose, nor honeyed lines of rhyme,\nCan blazon evil deeds, or consecrate a crime.\n\nIV.\n\nChilde Harold basked him in the noontide sun,\nDisporting there like any other fly,\nNor deemed before his little day was done\nOne blast might chill him into misery.\n\nBut long ere scarce a third of his passed by,\nWorse than adversity the Childe befell;\nHe felt the fulness of satiety:\nThen loathed he in his native land to dwell,\nWhich seemed to him more lone than eremite's sad cell.\n\nV.\n\nFor he through Sin's long labyrinth had run,\nNor made atonement when he did amiss,\nHad sighed to many, though he loved but one,\nAnd that loved one, alas, could ne'er be his.\n\nAh, happy she! to 'scape from him whose kiss\nHad been pollution unto aught so chaste;\nWho soon had left her charms for vulgar bliss,\nAnd spoiled her goodly lands to gild his waste,\nNor calm domestic peace had ever deigned to taste.\n\nVI.\n\nAnd now Childe Harold was sore sick at heart,\nAnd from his fellow bacchanals would flee;\n'Tis said, at times the sullen tear would start,\nBut pride congealed the drop within his e'e:\nApart he stalked in joyless reverie,\nAnd from his native land resolved to go,\nAnd visit scorching climes beyond the sea;\nWith pleasure drugged, he almost longed for woe,\nAnd e'en for change of scene would seek the shades below.\n\nVII.\n\nThe Childe departed from his father's hall;\nIt was a vast and venerable pile;\nSo old, it seemed only not to fall,\nYet strength was pillared in each massy aisle.\n\nMonastic dome! condemned to uses vile!\nWhere superstition once had made her den,\nNow Paphian girls were known to sing and smile;\nAnd monks might deem their time was come agen,\nIf ancient tales say true, nor wrong these holy men.\n\nVIII.\n\nYet ofttimes in his maddest mirthful mood,\nStrange pangs would flash along Childe Harold's brow,\nAs if the memory of some deadly feud\nOr disappointed passion lurked below:\nBut this none knew, nor haply cared to know;\nFor his was not that open, artless soul\nThat feels relief by bidding sorrow flow;\nNor sought he friend to counsel or condole,\nWhate'er this grief mote be, which he could not control.\n\nIX.\n\nAnd none did love him: though to hall and bower\nHe gathered revellers from far and near,\nHe knew them flatterers of the festal hour;\nThe heartless parasites of present cheer.\n\nYea, none did love him--not his lemans dear -\nBut pomp and power alone are woman's care,\nAnd where these are light Eros finds a feere;\nMaidens, like moths, are ever caught by glare,\nAnd Mammon wins his way where seraphs might despair.\n\nX.\n\nChilde Harold had a mother--not forgot,\nThough parting from that mother he did shun;\nA sister whom he loved, but saw her not\nBefore his weary pilgrimage begun:\nIf friends he had, he bade adieu to none.\n\nYet deem not thence his breast a breast of steel;\nYe, who have known what 'tis to dote upon\nA few dear objects, will in sadness feel\nSuch partings break the heart they fondly hope to heal.\n\nXI.\n\nHis house, his home, his heritage, his lands,\nThe laughing dames in whom he did delight,\nWhose large blue eyes, fair locks, and snowy hands,\nMight shake the saintship of an anchorite,\nAnd long had fed his youthful appetite;\nHis goblets brimmed with every costly wine,\nAnd all that mote to luxury invite,\nWithout a sigh he left to cross the brine,\nAnd traverse Paynim shores, and pass earth's central line.\n\nXII.\n\nThe sails were filled, and fair the light winds blew\nAs glad to waft him from his native home;\nAnd fast the white rocks faded from his view,\nAnd soon were lost in circumambient foam;\nAnd then, it may be, of his wish to roam\nRepented he, but in his bosom slept\nThe silent thought, nor from his lips did come\nOne word of wail, whilst others sate and wept,\nAnd to the reckless gales unmanly moaning kept.\n\nXIII.\n\nBut when the sun was sinking in the sea,\nHe seized his harp, which he at times could string,\nAnd strike, albeit with untaught melody,\nWhen deemed he no strange ear was listening:\nAnd now his fingers o'er it he did fling,\nAnd tuned his farewell in the dim twilight,\nWhile flew the vessel on her snowy wing,\nAnd fleeting shores receded from his sight,\nThus to the elements he poured his last 'Good Night.\n\nAdieu, adieu!

right well thou know'st the day of prayer:\nThen thy spruce citizen, washed artizan,\nAnd smug apprentice gulp their weekly air:\nThy coach of hackney, whiskey, one-horse chair,\nAnd humblest gig, through sundry suburbs whirl;\nTo Hampstead, Brentford, Harrow, make repair;\nTill the tired jade the wheel forgets to hurl,\nProvoking envious gibe from each pedestrian churl.\n\nLXX.\n\nSome o'er thy Thamis row the ribboned fair,\nOthers along the safer turnpike fly;\nSome Richmond Hill ascend, some scud to Ware,\nAnd many to the steep of Highgate hie.\n\nAsk ye, Boeotian shades, the reason why?\n\n'Tis to the worship of the solemn Horn,\nGrasped in the holy hand of Mystery,\nIn whose dread name both men and maids are sworn,\nAnd consecrate the oath with draught and dance till morn.\n\nLXXI.\n\nAll have their fooleries; not alike are thine,\nFair Cadiz, rising o'er the dark blue sea!\nSoon as the matin bell proclaimeth nine,\nThy saint adorers count the rosary:\nMuch is the Virgin teased to shrive them free\n(Well do I ween the only virgin there)\nFrom crimes as numerous as her beadsmen be;\nThen to the crowded circus forth they fare:\nYoung, old, high, low, at once the same diversion share.\n\nLXXII.\n\nThe lists are oped, the spacious area cleared,\nThousands on thousands piled are seated round;\nLong ere the first loud trumpet's note is heard,\nNo vacant space for lated wight is found:\nHere dons, grandees, but chiefly dames abound,\nSkilled in the ogle of a roguish eye,\nYet ever well inclined to heal the wound;\nNone through their cold disdain are doomed to die,\nAs moon-struck bards complain, by Love's sad archery.\n\nLXXIII.\n\nHushed is the din of tongues--on gallant steeds,\nWith milk-white crest, gold spur, and light-poised lance,\nFour cavaliers prepare for venturous deeds,\nAnd lowly bending to the lists advance;\nRich are their scarfs, their chargers featly prance:\nIf in the dangerous game they shine to-day,\nThe crowd's loud shout, and ladies' lovely glance,\nBest prize of better acts, they bear away,\nAnd all that kings or chiefs e'er gain their toils repay.\n\nLXXIV.\n\nIn costly sheen and gaudy cloak arrayed,\nBut all afoot, the light-limbed matadore\nStands in the centre, eager to invade\nThe lord of lowing herds; but not before\nThe ground, with cautious tread, is traversed o'er,\nLest aught unseen should lurk to thwart his speed:\nHis arms a dart, he fights aloof, nor more\nCan man achieve without the friendly steed -\nAlas! too oft condemned for him to bear and bleed.\n\nLXXV.\n\nThrice sounds the clarion; lo! the signal falls,\nThe den expands, and expectation mute\nGapes round the silent circle's peopled walls.\n\nBounds with one lashing spring the mighty brute,\nAnd wildly staring, spurns, with sounding foot,\nThe sand, nor blindly rushes on his foe:\nHere, there, he points his threatening front, to suit\nHis first attack, wide waving to and fro\nHis angry tail; red rolls his eye's dilated glow.\n\nLXXVI.\n\nSudden he stops; his eye is fixed: away,\nAway, thou heedless boy! prepare the spear;\nNow is thy time to perish, or display\nThe skill that yet may check his mad career.\n\nWith well-timed croupe the nimble coursers veer;\nOn foams the bull, but not unscathed he goes;\nStreams from his flank the crimson torrent clear:\nHe flies, he wheels, distracted with his throes:\nDart follows dart; lance, lance; loud bellowings speak his woes.\n\nLXXVII.\n\nAgain he comes; nor dart nor lance avail,\nNor the wild plunging of the tortured horse;\nThough man and man's avenging arms assail,\nVain are his weapons, vainer is his force.\n\nOne gallant steed is stretched a mangled corse;\nAnother, hideous sight! unseamed appears,\nHis gory chest unveils life's panting source;\nThough death-struck, still his feeble frame he rears;\nStaggering, but stemming all, his lord unharmed he bears.\n\nLXXVIII.\n\nFoiled, bleeding, breathless, furious to the last,\nFull in the centre stands the bull at bay,\nMid wounds, and clinging darts, and lances brast,\nAnd foes disabled in the brutal fray:\nAnd now the matadores around him play,\nShake the red cloak, and poise the ready brand:\nOnce more through all he bursts his thundering way -\nVain rage! the mantle quits the conynge hand,\nWraps his fierce eye--'tis past--he sinks upon the sand.\n\nLXXIX.\n\nWhere his vast neck just mingles with the spine,\nSheathed in his form the deadly weapon lies.\n\nHe stops--he starts--disdaining to decline:\nSlowly he falls, amidst triumphant cries,\nWithout a groan, without a struggle dies.\n\nThe decorated car appears on high:\nThe corse is piled--sweet sight for vulgar eyes;\nFour steeds that spurn the rein, as swift as shy,\nHurl the dark bull along, scarce seen in dashing by.\n\nLXXX.\n\nSuch the ungentle sport that oft invites\nThe Spanish maid, and cheers the Spanish swain:\nNurtured in blood betimes, his heart delights\nIn vengeance, gloating on another's pain.\n\nWhat private feuds the troubled village stain!\nThough now one phalanxed host should meet the foe,\nEnough, alas, in humble homes remain,\nTo meditate 'gainst friends the secret blow,\nFor some slight cause of wrath, whence life's warm stream must flow.\n\nLXXXI.\n\nBut Jealousy has fled: his bars, his bolts,\nHis withered sentinel, duenna sage!\nAnd all whereat the generous soul revolts,\nWhich the stern dotard deemed he could encage,\nHave passed to darkness with the vanished age.\n\nWho late so free as Spanish girls were seen\n(Ere War uprose in his volcanic rage),\nWith braided tresses bounding o'er the green,\nWhile on the gay dance shone Night's lover-loving Queen?\n\nLXXXII.\n\nOh! many a time and oft had Harold loved,\nOr dreamed he loved, since rapture is a dream;\nBut now his wayward bosom was unmoved,\nFor not yet had he drunk of Lethe's stream:\nAnd lately had he learned with truth to deem\nLove has no gift so grateful as his wings:\nHow fair, how young, how soft soe'er he seem,\nFull from the fount of joy's delicious springs\nSome bitter o'er the flowers its bubbling venom flings.\n\nLXXXIII.\n\nYet to the beauteous form he was not blind,\nThough now it moved him as it moves the wise;\nNot that Philosophy on such a mind\nE'er deigned to bend her chastely-awful eyes:\nBut Passion raves itself to rest, or flies;\nAnd Vice, that digs her own voluptuous tomb,\nHad buried long his hopes, no more to rise:\nPleasure's palled victim! life-abhorring gloom\nWrote on his faded brow curst Cain's unresting doom.\n\nLXXXIV.\n\nStill he beheld, nor mingled with the throng;\nBut viewed them not with misanthropic hate;\nFain would he now have joined the dance, the song,\nBut who may smile that sinks beneath his fate?\n\nNought that he saw his sadness could abate:\nYet once he struggled 'gainst the demon's sway,\nAnd as in Beauty's bower he pensive sate,\nPoured forth this unpremeditated lay,\nTo charms as fair as those that soothed his happier day.\n\nTO INEZ.\n\nNay, smile not at my sullen brow,\nAlas! I cannot smile again:\nYet Heaven avert that ever thou\nShouldst weep, and haply weep in vain.\n\nAnd dost thou ask what secret woe\nI bear, corroding joy and youth?\n\nAnd wilt thou vainly seek to know\nA pang even thou must fail to soothe?\n\nIt is not love, it is not hate,\nNor low Ambition's honours lost,\nThat bids me loathe my present state,\nAnd fly from all I prized the most:\nIt is that weariness which springs\nFrom all I meet, or hear, or see:\nTo me no pleasure Beauty brings;\nThine eyes have scarce a charm for me.\n\nIt is that settled, ceaseless gloom\nThe fabled Hebrew wanderer bore,\nThat will not look beyond the tomb,\nBut cannot hope for rest before.\n\nWhat exile from himself can flee?\n\nTo zones, though more and more remote,\nStill, still pursues, where'er I be,\nThe blight of life--the demon Thought.\n\nYet others rapt in pleasure seem,\nAnd taste of all that I forsake:\nOh! may they still of transport dream,\nAnd ne'er, at least like me, awake!\nThrough many a clime 'tis mine to go,\nWith many a retrospection curst;\nAnd all my solace is to know,\nWhate'er betides, I've known the worst.\n\nWhat is that worst?\n\nNay, do not ask -\nIn pity from the search forbear:\nSmile on--nor venture to unmask\nMan's heart, and view the hell that's there.\n\nLXXXV.\n\nAdieu, fair Cadiz! yea, a long adieu!\nWho may forget how well thy walls have stood?\n\nWhen all were changing, thou alone wert true,\nFirst to be free, and last to be subdued.\n\nAnd if amidst a scene, a shock so rude,\nSome native blood was seen thy streets to dye,\nA traitor only fell beneath the feud:\nHere all were noble, save nobility;\nNone hugged a conqueror's chain save fallen Chivalry!\nLXXXVI.\n\nSuch be the sons of Spain, and strange her fate!\nThey fight for freedom, who were never free;\nA kingless people for a nerveless state,\nHer vassals combat when their chieftains flee,\nTrue to the veriest slaves of Treachery;\nFond of a land which gave them nought but life,\nPride points the path that leads to liberty;\nBack to the struggle, baffled in the strife,\nWar, war is still the cry, 'War even to the knife!'\nLXXXVII.\n\nYe, who would more of Spain and Spaniards know,\nGo, read whate'er is writ of bloodiest strife:\nWhate'er keen Vengeance urged on foreign foe\nCan act, is acting there against man's life:\nFrom flashing scimitar to secret knife,\nWar mouldeth there each weapon to his need -\nSo may he guard the sister and the wife,\nSo may he make each curst oppressor bleed,\nSo may such foes deserve the most remorseless deed!\nLXXXVIII.\n\nFlows there a tear of pity for the dead?\n\nLook o'er the ravage of the reeking plain:\nLook on the hands with female slaughter red;\nThen to the dogs resign the unburied slain,\nThen to the vulture let each corse remain;\nAlbeit unworthy of the prey-bird's maw,\nLet their bleached bones, and blood's unbleaching stain,\nLong mark the battle-field with hideous awe:\nThus only may our sons conceive the scenes we saw!\nLXXXIX.\n\nNor yet, alas, the dreadful work is done;\nFresh legions pour adown the Pyrenees:\nIt deepens still, the work is scarce begun,\nNor mortal eye the distant end foresees.\n\nFall'n nations gaze on Spain: if freed, she frees\nMore than her fell Pizarros once enchained.\n\nStrange retribution! now Columbia's ease\nRepairs the wrongs that Quito's sons sustained,\nWhile o'er the parent clime prowls Murder unrestrained.\n\nXC.\n\nNot all the blood at Talavera shed,\nNot all the marvels of Barossa's fight,\nNot Albuera lavish of the dead,\nHave won for Spain her well-asserted right.\n\nWhen shall her Olive-Branch be free from blight?\n\nWhen shall she breathe her from the blushing toil?\n\nHow many a doubtful day shall sink in night,\nEre the Frank robber turn him from his spoil,\nAnd Freedom's stranger-tree grow native of the soil?\n\nXCI.\n\nAnd thou, my friend!

yet once more!\nAnd the waves bound beneath me as a steed\nThat knows his rider.\n\nWelcome, to their roar!\nSwift be their guidance, wheresoe'er it lead!\nThough the strain'd mast should quiver as a reed,\nAnd the rent canvas fluttering strew the gale,\nStill must I on; for I am as a weed,\nFlung from the rock, on Ocean's foam, to sail\nWhere'er the surge may sweep, or tempest's breath prevail.\n\nIII.\n\nIn my youth's summer I did sing of One,\nThe wandering outlaw of his own dark mind;\nAgain I seize the theme then but begun,\nAnd bear it with me, as the rushing wind\nBears the cloud onwards: in that Tale I find\nThe furrows of long thought, and dried-up tears,\nWhich, ebbing, leave a sterile track behind,\nO'er which all heavily the journeying years\nPlod the last sands of life,--where not a flower appears.\n\nIV.\n\nSince my young days of passion--joy, or pain,\nPerchance my heart and harp have lost a string,\nAnd both may jar: it may be, that in vain\nI would essay as I have sung to sing.\n\nYet, though a dreary strain, to this I cling;\nSo that it wean me from the weary dream\nOf selfish grief or gladness--so it fling\nForgetfulness around me--it shall seem\nTo me, though to none else, a not ungrateful theme.\n\nV.\n\nHe, who grown aged in this world of woe,\nIn deeds, not years, piercing the depths of life,\nSo that no wonder waits him; nor below\nCan love, or sorrow, fame, ambition, strife,\nCut to his heart again with the keen knife\nOf silent, sharp endurance: he can tell\nWhy thought seeks refuge in lone caves, yet rife\nWith airy images, and shapes which dwell\nStill unimpair'd, though old, in the soul's haunted cell.\n\nVI.\n\n'Tis to create, and in creating life\nA being more intense, that we endow\nWith form our fancy, gaining as we give\nThe life we image, even as I do now.\n\nWhat am I?\n\nNothing; but not so art thou,\nSoul of my thought! with whom I traverse earth,\nInvisible but gazing, as I grow\nMix'd with thy spirit, blended with thy birth,\nAnd feeling still with thee in my crush'd feeling's dearth.\n\nVII.\n\nYet must I think less wildly:--I have thought\nToo long and darkly, till my brain became,\nIn its own eddy boiling and o'erwrought,\nA whirling gulf of phantasy and flame:\nAnd thus, untaught in youth my heart to tame,\nMy springs of life were poison'd.\n\n'Tis too late!\nYet am I chang'd; though still enough the same\nIn strength to bear what time can not abate,\nAnd feed on bitter fruits without accusing Fate.\n\nVIII.\n\nSomething too much of this:--but now 'tis past,\nAnd the spell closes with its silent seal.\n\nLong absent HAROLD re-appears at last;\nHe of the breast which fain no more would feel,\nWrung with the wounds which kill not, but ne'er heal;\nYet Time, who changes all, had altered him\nIn sould and aspect as in age: years steal\nFire from the mind as vigour from the limb;\nAnd life's enchanted cup but sparkles near the brim.\n\nIX.\n\nHis had been quaff'd too quickly, and he found\nThe dregs were wormwood; but he fill'd again,\nAnd from a purer fount, on holier ground,\nAnd deem'd its spring perpetual; but in vain!\nStill round him clung invisibly a chain\nWhich gall'd for ever, fettering though unseen,\nAnd heavy though it clank'd not; worn with pain,\nWhich pined although it spoke not, and grew keen,\nEntering with every step, he took, through many a scene.\n\nX.\n\nSecure in guarded coldness, he had mix'd\nAgain in fancied safety with his kind,\nAnd deem'd his spirit now so firmly fix'd\nAnd sheath'd with an invulnerable mind,\nThat, if no joy, no sorrow lurk'd behind;\nAnd he, as one, might midst the many stand\nUnheeded, searching through the crowd to find\nFit speculation! such as in strange land\nHe found in wonder-works of God and Nature's hand.\n\nXI.\n\nBut who can view the ripened rose, nor seek\nTo wear it?\n\nwho can curiously behold\nThe smoothness and the sheen of beauty's cheek,\nNor feel the heart can never all grow old?\n\nWho can contemplate Fame through clouds unfold\nThe star which rises o'er her steep, nor climb?\n\nHarold, once more within the vortex, roll'd\nOn with the giddy circle, chasing Time,\nYet with a nobler aim than in his youth's fond prime.\n\nXII.\n\nBut soon he knew himself the most unfit\nOf men to herd with man; with whom he held\nLittle in common; untaught to submit\nHis thoughts to others, though his soul was quell'd\nIn youth by his own thoughts; still uncompell'd,\nHe would not yield dominion of his mind\nTo spirits against whom his own rebell'd;\nProud though in desolation; which could find\nA life within itself, to breathe without mankind.\n\nXIII.\n\nWhere rose the mountains, there to him were friends;\nWhere roll'd the ocean, theron was his home;\nWhere a blue sky, and glowing clime, extends,\nHe had the passion and the power to roam;\nThe desert, forest, cavern, breaker's foam,\nWere unto him companionship; they spake\nA mutual language, clearer than the tome\nOf his land's tongue, which he would oft forsake\nFor Nature's pages glass'd by sunbeams on the lake.\n\nXIV.\n\nLike the Chaldean, he could watch the stars,\nTill he had peopled them with beings bright\nAs their own beams; and earth, and earth-born jars,\nAnd human frailties, were forgotten quite:\nCould he have kept his spirit to that flight\nHe had been happy; but this clay will sink\nIts spark immortal, envying it the light\nTo which it mounts, as if to break the link\nThat keeps us from yon heaven which woos us to its brink.\n\nXV.\n\nBut in Man's dwellings he became a thing\nRestless and worn, and stern and wearisome,\nDroop'd as a wild-born falcon with clipt wing,\nTo whom the boundless air alone were home:\nThen came his fit again, which to o'ercome,\nAs eagerly the barr'd-up bird will beat\nHis breast and beak against his wiry dome\nTill the blood tinge his plumage, so the heat\nOf his impeded soul would through his bosom eat.\n\nXVI.\n\nSelf-exiled Harold wanders forth again,\nWith nought of hope left, but with less of gloom;\nThe very knowledge that he lived in vain,\nThat all was over on this side the tomb,\nHad made Despair a smilingness assume,\nWhich, though 'twer wild,--as on the plundered wreck\nWhen mariners would madly meet their doom\nWith draughts intemperate on the sinking deck,--\nDid yet inspire a cheer, which he forbore to check.\n\nXVII.\n\nStop!--for thy tread is on an Empire's dust!\nAn earthquake's spoil is sepulchred below!\nIs the spot mark'd with no colossal bust?\n\nNor column trophied for triumphal show?\n\nNone; but the moral's truth tells simpler so,\nAs the ground was before, thus let it be;--\nHow that red rain hath made the harvest grow!\nAnd is this all the world has gained by thee\nThou first and last of fields! king-making Victory?\n\nXVIII.\n\nAnd Harold stands upon this place of skulls,\nThe grave of France, the deadly Waterloo!\nHow in an hour the power which gave annuls\nIts gifts, transferring fame as fleeting too!\nIn 'pride of place' here last the eagle flew,\nThen tore with bloody talon the rent plain,\nPierced by the shaft of banded nations through;\nAmbition's life and labours all were vain;\nHe wears the shattered links of the world's broken chain.\n\nXIX.\n\nFit retribution! Gaul may champ the bit\nAnd foam in fetters;--but is Earth more free?\n\nDid nations combat to make One submit;\nOr league to teach all kings true sovereignty?\n\nWhat! shall reviving Thraldom again be\nThe patched-up idol of enlightened days?\n\nShall we, who struck the Lion down, shall we\nPay the Wolf homage?\n\nproffering lowly gaze\nAnd servile knees to thrones?\n\nNo; prove before ye praise!\nXX.\n\nIf not, o'er one fallen despot boast no more!\nIn vain fair cheeks were furrowed with hot tears\nFor Europe's flowers long rooted up before\nThe trampler of her vineyards; in vain years\nOf death, depopulation, bondage, fears,\nHave all been borne, and broken by the accord\nOf roused-up millions: all tha tmost endears\nGlory, is when the myrtle wreathes a sword\nSuch as Harmodius drew on Athen's tyrant lord.\n\nXXI.\n\nThere was a sound of revelry by night,\nAnd Belgium's capital had gathered then\nHer Beauty and her Chivalry, and bright\nThe lamps shone o'er fair women and brave men;\nA thousand hearts beat happily; and when\nMusic arose with its voluptuous swell,\nSoft eyes look'd love to eyes which spake again,\nAnd all went merry as a marriage-bell;\nBut hush! hark! a deep sound strikes like a rising knell!\nXXII.\n\nDid ye not hear it?\n\n--No; 'twas but the wind,\nOr the car rattling o'er the stony stret;\nOn with the dance! let joy e unconfined;\nNo sleep till morn, when Youth and Pleasure meet\nTo chase the glowing Hours with flying feet--\nBut, hark!--that heavy sound breaks in once more,\nAs if the clouds its echo would repeat;\nAnd nearer, clearer, deadlier than before!\nArm! Arm! and out--it is--the cannon's opening roar!\nXXIII.\n\nWithin a windowed niche of that high hall\nSate Brunswick's fated chieftain; he did hear\nThat sound the first amidst the festival,\nAnd caught its tone with Death's prophetic ear;\nAnd when they smiled because he deem'd it near,\nHis heart more turly knew hat peal too well\nWhich stretch'd his father on a bloody bier,\nAnd roused the vengeance blood alone could quell:\nHe rush'd into the field, and, foremost fighting, fell.\n\nXXIV.\n\nAh! then and there was hurrying to and fro,\nAnd gathering tears, and tremblings of distress,\nAnd cheeks all pale, which but an hour ago\nBlush'd at the priase of their own loveliness;\nAnd there were sudden partings, such as press\nThe life from out young hearts, and choking sighs\nWhich ne'er might be repeated; who could guess\nIf ever more should meet those mutual eyes,\nSince upon nights so sweet such awful morn could rise?\n\nXXV.\n\nAnd there was mounting in hot haste: the steed,\nThe mustering squadron, and the clattering car,\nWent pouring forward in impetuous speed,\nAnd swiftly forming in the ranks of war;\nAnd the deep thunder peal on peal afar;\nAnd near, the beat of the alarming drum\nRoused up the soldier ere the morning star;\nWhile throng'd the citizens with terror dumb,\nOr whispering, with white lips--'The foe! They come! they come!'\nXXVI.\n\nAnd wild and high the 'Cameron's gathering' rose!\nThe war-note of Lochiel, which Albyn's hills\nHave heard, and heard, too, have her Saxon foes:--\nHow in the noon of night that pibroch thrills,\nSavage and shrill! But with the breath which fills\nTheir mountain-pipe, so fill the mountaineers\nWith the fierce native daring which instils\nThe stirring memory of a thousand years,\nAnd Evan's, Donald's fame rings in each clansman's ears!\nXXVII.\n\nAnd Ardennes waves above them her green leaves,\nDewy with nature's tear-drops, as they pass,\nGrieving, if aught inanimate e'er grieves,\nOver the unreturning brave,--alas!\nEre evening to be trodden like the grass\nWhich now beneath them, but above shall grow\nIn its next verdure, when this fiery mass\nOf living valour, rolling on the foe\nAnd burning with high hope, shall moulder cold and low.\n\nXXVIII.\n\nLast noon beheld them full of lusty life,\nLast eve in Beauty's circle proudly gay,\nThe midnight brought the signal-sound of strife,\nThe morn the marshalling in arms,--the day\nBattle's magnificently-stern array!\nThe thunder-clouds close o'er it, which when rent\nThe earth is covered thick with other clay,\nWhich her own clay shall cover, heaped and pent,\nRider and horse,--friend, foe,--in one red burial blent!\nXXIX.\n\nTheir praise is hymn'd by loftier harps than mine;\nYet one I would select from that proud throng,\nPartly because they blend me with his line,\nAnd partly that I did his sire some wrong,\nAnd partly that bright names will hallow song;\nAnd his was of the bravest, and when shower'd\nThe death-bolts deadliest the thinn'd files along,\nEven where the thickest of war's tempest lower'd,\nThey reach'd no nobler breast than thine, young, gallant Howard!\nXXX.\n\nThere have been tears and breaking hearts for thee,\nAnd mine were nothing, had I such to give;\nBut when I stood beneath the fresh green tree,\nWhich living waves where thou didst cease to live,\nAnd saw around me the wide field revive\nWith fruits and fertile promise, and the Spring\nCome forth her work of gladness to contrive,\nWith all her reckless birds upon the wing,\nI turn'd from all she brought to those she could not bring.\n\nXXXI.\n\nI turn'd to thee, to thousands, of whom each\nAnd one as all a ghastly gap did make\nIn his own kind and kindred, whom to teach\nForgetfulness were mercy for their sake;\nThe Archangel's trump, not Glory's, must awake\nThose whom they thirst for; though the sound of Fame\nMay for a moment sooth, it cannot slake\nThe fever of vain longing, and the name\nSo honoured but assumes a stronger, bitterer claim.\n\nXXXII.\n\nThey mourn, but smile at length; and, smiling, mourn:\nThe tree will wither long before it fall;\nThe hull drives on, though mast and sail be torn;\nThe roof-tree sinks, but moulders on the hall\nIn massy hoariness; the ruined wall\nStands when its wind-worn batlements are gone;\nThe bars survive the captive they enthral;\nThe day drags through though storms keep out the sun;\nAnd thus the heart will break, yet brokenly live on:\nXXXIII.\n\nEven as a broken mirrow, which the glass\nIn every fragment multiplies; and makes\nA thousand images of one that was,\nThe same, and still the more, the more it breaks;\nAnd thus the heart will do which not forsakes,\nLiving in shattered guise, and still, and cold,\nAnd bloodless, with its sleepless sorrow aches,\nYet withers on till all without is old,\nShewing no visible sign, for such things are untold.\n\nXXXIV.\n\nThere is a very life in our despair,\nVitality of poison,--a quick root\nWhich feeds these deadly brances; for it were\nAs nothing did we die; but Life will suit\nItself to Sorrow's most detested fruit,\nLike to the apples on the Dead Sea's shore,\nAll ashes to the taste: Did man compute\nExistence by enjoyment, and count o'er\nSuch hours 'gainst years of life,--says, would he name three-score?\n\nXXXV.\n\nThe Psalmist numbered out the years of man:\nThey are enough; and if thy tale be true,\nThou, who didst grudge him even that fleeting span,\nMore than enough, thoufatal Waterloo!\nMillions of tongues record thee, and anew\nTheir children's lips shall echo them, and say--\n'Here, where the sword united nations drew,\nOur countrymen were warring on that day!'\nAnd this is much, and all which will not pass away.\n\nXXXVI.\n\nThere sunk the greatest, nor the worst of men,\nWhose spirit antithetically mixt\nOne moment of the mightiest, and again\nOn little objects with like firmness fixt,\nExtreme in all things!

what stings\nAre theirs! One breast laid open were a school\nWhich would unteach mankind the lust to shine or rule:\nXLIV.\n\nTheir breath is agitation, and their life\nA storm whereon they ride, to sink at last,\nAnd yet so nurs'd and bigotted to strife,\nThat should their days, surviving perils past,\nMelt to calm twilight, they feel overcast\nWith sorrow and supineness, and so die;\nEven as a flame unfed, which runs to waste\nWith its own flickering, or a sword laid by\nWhich eats into itself, and rusts ingloriously.\n\nXLV.\n\nHe who ascends to mountain-tops, shall find\nThe loftiest peaks most wrapt in clouds and snow;\nHe who surpasses or subdues mankind,\nMust look down on the hate of those below.\n\nThough high above the sun of glory glow,\nAnd far beneath the earth and ocean ocean spread,\nRound him are icy rocks, and loudly blow\nContending tempests on his naked head,\nAnd thus reward the toils which to those summits led.\n\nXLVI.\n\nAway with these! true Wisdom's world will be\nWithin its own creation, or in thine,\nMaternal Nature! for who teems like thee,\nThus on the banks of thy majestic Rhine?\n\nThere Harold gazes on a work divine,\nA blending of all beauties; streams and dells,\nFruit, foilage, crag, wood, cornfield, mountain, vine,\nAnd chiefless castles breathing stern farewells\nFrom gray but leafy walls, where Ruin greenly dwells.\n\nXLVII.\n\nAnd there they stand, as stands a lofty mind,\nWorn, but unstooping to the baser crowd,\nAll tenantless, save to the crannying wind,\nOr holding dark communion with the cloud.\n\nThere was a day when they were young and proud,\nBanners on high, and battles pass'd below;\nBut they who fought are in a bloody shroud,\nAnd those which waved are shredless dust ere now,\nAnd the bleak battlements shall bear no future blow.\n\nXLVIII.\n\nBeneath these battlements, within those walls,\nPower dwelt amidst her passions; in proud state\nEach robber chief upheld his armed halls,\nDoing his evil will, nor less elate\nThan mightier heroes of a longer date.\n\nWhat want these outlaws conquerors should have\nBut History's purchased page to call them great?\n\nA wider space, an ornamented grave?\n\nTheir hopes were not less warm, their souls were full as brave.\n\nXLIX.\n\nIn their baronial feuds and single fields,\nWhat deed of prowess unrecorded died!\nAnd Love, which lent a blazon to their shields,\nWith emblems well devised by amorous pride,\nThrough all the mail of iron hearts would glide;\nBut still their flame was fierceness, and drew on\nKeen contest and destruction near allied,\nAnd many a tower for some fair mischief won,\nSaw the discoloured Rhine beneath its ruin run.\n\nL.\n\nBut Thou, exulting and abounding river!\nMaking thy waves a blessing as they flow\nThrough banks whose beauty would endure for ever\nCould man but leave thy bright creation so,\nNor its fair promise from the surface mow\nWith the sharp scythe of conflict,--then to see\nThy valley of sweet waters, were to know\nEarth paved like Heaven; and to seem such to me\nEven now what wants thy stream?\n\n--that it should Lethe be.\n\nLI.\n\nA thousand battles have assail'd thy banks,\nBut these and half their fame have pass'd away,\nAnd Slaughter heap'd on high his weltering ranks;\nTheir very graves are gone, band what are they?\n\nThy tide wash'd down the blood of yesterday,\nAnd all was stainless, and on thy clear stream\nGlass'd with its dancing light the sunny ray;\nBut o'er the blackened memory's blighting dream\nThy waves would vainly roll, all sweeping as they seem.\n\nLII.\n\nThus Harold inly said, and pass'd along,\nYet not insensibly to all which here\nAwoke the jocund birds to early song\nIn glens which might have made even exile dear:\nThough on his brow were graven lines austere,\nAnd tranquil sternnes which had ta'en the place\nOf feelings fierier far but less severe,\nJoy was not always absent from his face,\nBut o'er it in such scenes would steal with transient trace.\n\nLIII.\n\nNor was all love shut from him, though his days\nOf passion had consumed themselves to dust.\n\nIt is in vain that we would coldly gaze\nOn such as smile upon us; the heart must\nLeak kindly back to kindness, though disgust\nHath wean'd it from all worldlings: thus he felt,\nFor there was soft remembrance, and sweet trust\nIn one fond breast, to which his own would melt,\nAnd in its tenderer hour on that his bosom dwelt.\n\nLIV.\n\nAnd he had learn'd to love,--I know not why,\nFor this in such as him seems strange of mood,--\nThe helpless looks of blooming infancy,\nEven in its earliest nurture; what subdued,\nTo change like this, a mind so far imbued\nWith scorn of man, it little boots to know;\nBut thus it was; and though in solitude\nSmall power the nipp'd affections have to grow,\nIn him this glowed when all beside had ceased to glow.\n\nLV.\n\nAnd there was one soft breast, as hath been said,\nWhich unto his was bound by stronger ties\nThan the church links withal; and, though unwed,\nThat love was pure, and, far above disguise,\nHad stood the test of mortal enmities\nStill undivided, and cemented more\nBy peril, dreaded most in female eyes;\nBut this was firm, and from a foreign shore\nWell to that heart might his these absent greetings pour!\n1\nThe castled crag of Drachenfels\nFrowns o'er the wide and winding Rhine,\nWhose breast of waters broadly swells\nBetween the banks which bear the vine,\nAnd hills all rich with blossomed trees,\nAnd fields which promise corn and wine,\nAnd scattered cities crowning these,\nWhose far white walls along them shine,\nHave strewed a scene, which I should see\nWith double joy were thou with me!\n2\nAnd peasant girls, with deep blue eyes,\nAnd hand which offer early flowers,\nWalk smiling o'er this paradise\nAbove, the frequent feudal towers\nThrough green leaves lift their walls of grey,\nAnd many a rock which steeply lours,\nAnd noble arch in proud decay,\nLook o'er this vale of vintage-bowers;\nBut one thing want these banks of Rhine,--\nThy gentle hand to clasp in mine!\n3\nI send the lilies given to me;\nThough long before thy hand they touch,\nI know that they must withered be,\nBut yet reject them not as such;\nFor I have cherish'd them as dear,\nBecause they yet may meet thine eye,\nAnd guide thy sould to mine even here,\nWhen thou behold'st them drooping night,\nAnd knowst them gathered by the Rhine,\nAnd offered from my heart to thine!\n4\nThe river nobly foams and flows,\nThe charm of this enchanted ground,\nAnd all its thousand turns disclose\nSome fresher beauty varying round;\nThe haughtiest breast its wish might bound\nThrough life to dwell delighted here;\nNor could on earth a spot be found\nTo nature and to me so dear,\nCould thy dear eyes in following mine\nStill sweeten more these banks of Rhine!\nLVI.\n\nBy Coblentz, on a rise of gentle ground,\nThere is a small and simply pyramid,\nCrowning the summit of the verdant mound;\nBeneath its base are heroes' ashes hid,\nOur enemy's,--but let not that forbid\nHonour to Marceau! o'er whose early tomb\nTears, big tears, gush'd from the rough soldier's lid,\nLamenting and yet envying such a doom,\nFalling for France, whose rights he battled to resume.\n\nLVII.\n\nBrief, brave, and glorious was his young career,--\nHis mourners were two hosts, his friends and foes;\nAnd fitly may the stranger lingering here\nPray for his gallant spirit's bright repose;\nFor he was Freedom's champion, one of those,\nThe few in number, who had not o'erstept\nThe charter to chastise which she bestows\nOn such as wield her weapons; he had kept\nThe whiteness of his soul, and thus men o'er him wept.\n\nLVIII.\n\nHere Ehrenbreitstein, with her shattered wall\nBlack with the miner's blast, upon her height\nYet shows of what she was, when shell and ball\nRebounding idly on her strength did light;\nA tower of victory! from whence the flight\nOf baffled foes was watch'd along the plain:\nBut Peace destroy'd what War could never blight,\nAnd laid those proud roofs bare to Summer's rain--\nOn which the iron shower for years had pour'd in vain.\n\nLIX.\n\nAdieu to thee, fair Rhine! How long delighted\nThe stranger fain would linger on his way!\nThine is a scene alike where souls united\nOr lonely Contemplation thus might stray;\nAnd could the ceaseless vultures cease to prey\nOn self-condemning bosoms, it were here,\nWhere Nature, nor too sombre nor too gay,\nWild but not rude, awful yet not austere,\nIs to the mellow Earth as Autumn to the year.\n\nLX.\n\nAdieu to thee again! a vain adieu!\nThere can be found no farewell to scene like thine;\nThe mind is coloured by thy every hue;\nAnd if reluctantly the eyes resign\nTheir cherish'd gaze upon thee, lovely Rhine!\n'Tis with the thankful glance of parting praise;\nMore mighty spots may rise--more glaring shine,\nBut none unite in one attaching maze\nThe brilliant, fair, and soft,--the glories of old days,\nLXI.\n\nThe negligently grand, the fruitful bloom\nOf coming ripeness, the white city's sheen,\nThe rolling stream, the precipice's gloom,\nThe forest's growth, and Gothic's walls between,\nThe wild rocks shaped as they had turrets been\nIn mockery of man's art; and these withal\nA race of faces happy as the scene,\nWhose fertile bounties extend to all,\nStill sprining o'er thy banks, though Empires near them fall.\n\nLXII.\n\nBut these recede.\n\nAbove me are the Alps,\nThe palaces of Nature, whose vast walls\nHave pinnacled in clouds their snowy scalps,\nAnd throned Eternity in icy halls\nOf cold sublimity, where forms and falls\nThe avalanche--the thunderbolt of snow!\nAll which expands the spirit, yet appals,\nGather around these summits, as to show\nHow Earth may pierce to Heaven, yet leave vain man below.\n\nLXIII.\n\nBut ere these matchless heights I dare to scan,\nThere is a spot should not be pass'd in vain,--\nMorat! the proud, the patriot field! where man\nMay gaze on ghastly trophies of the slain,\nNor blush for those who conquered on that plain;\nHere Burgundy bequeath'd his tombless host,\nA bony heap, through ages to remain,\nThemselves their monument;--the Stygian coast\nUnsepulchred they roam'd, and shriek'd each wandering ghost.\n\nLXIV.\n\nWhile Waterloo with Cannae's carnage vies,\nMorat and Marathon twin names shall stand;\nThey were true Glory's stainless victories,\nWon by the unambitious heart and hand\nOf a proud, brotherly, and civic band,\nAll unbought champions in no princely cause\nOf vice-entail'd Corruption; they no land\nDoom'd to bewail the blasphemy of laws\nMaking kings' rights divine, by some Draconic clause.\n\nLXV.\n\nBy a lone wall a lonelier column rears\nA gray and grief-worn aspect of old days,\n'Tis the last remnant of the wreck of years,\nAnd looks as with the wild-bewildered gaze\nOf one to stone converted by amaze,\nYet still with consciousness; and there it stands\nMaking a marvel that it not decays,\nWhen the coeval pride of human hands,\nLevell'd Aventicum, hath strewed her subject lands.\n\nLXVI.\n\nAnd there--oh! sweet and sacred be the name!--\nJulia--the daughter, the devoted--gave\nHer youth to Heaven; her heart, beneath a claim\nNearest to Heaven's, broke o'er a father's grave.\n\nJustice is sworn 'gainst tears, and hers would crave\nThe life she lived in; but the judge was just,\nAnd then she died on him she could not save.\n\nTheir tomb was simple, and without a bust,\nAnd held within their urn one mind, one heart, one dust.\n\nLXVII.\n\nBut these are deeds which should not ass away,\nAnd names that must not wither, though the earth\nForgets her empires with a just decay,\nThe enslavers and the enslaved, their death and birth;\nThe high, the mountain-majesty of worth\nShould be, and shall, survivor of its woe,\nAnd from its immortality look forth\nIn the sun's face, like yonder Alpine snow;\nImperishably pure beyond all things below.\n\nLXVIII.\n\nLake Leman woos me with its crystal face,\nThe mirror where the stars and mountains view\nThe stillness of their aspect in each trace\nIts clear depth yields of their far height and hue:\nThere is too much of man here, to look through\nWith a fit mindt he might which I behold;\nBut soon in me shall Loneliness renew\nThoughts hid, but not less cherish'd than of old,\nEre mingling with the herd had penn'd me in their fold.\n\nLXIX.\n\nTo fly from, need not be to hate, mankind;\nAll are not fit with them to stire and toil,\nNor is it discontent to keep the mind\nDeep in its fountain, lest it overvoil\nIn the hot throng, where we become the spoil\nOf our infection, till too late and long\nWe may deplore and struggle with the coil,\nIn wretched interchange of wrong for wrong\n'Midst a contentious world, striving where none are strong.\n\nLXX.\n\nThere, in a moment, we may plunge our years\nIn fatal penitence, and in the blight\nOf our own soul, turn all our blood to tears,\nAnd colour things to come with hues of Night;\nThe race of life becomes a hopeless flight\nTo those that walk in darkness: on the sea,\nThe boldest steer but where their ports invite,\nBut there are wanderers o'er Eternity\nWhose bark drives on and one, and anchored ne'er shall be.\n\nLXXI.\n\nIs it not better, then, to be alone,\nAnd love Earth only for its earthly sake?\n\nBy the blue rushing of the arrowy Rhone,\nOr the pure bosom of its nursing lake,\nWhich feeds it as a mother who doth make\nA fair but froward infant her own care,\nKissing its cries away as these awake;--\nIs it not better thus our lives to wear,\nThan join the crushing crowd, doom'd to inflict or bear?\n\nLXXII.\n\nI live not in myself, but I become\nPortion of that around me; and to me\nHigh mountains are a feeling, but the hum\nOf human cities torture: I can see\nNothing to loathe in nature, save to be\nA link reluctant in a fleshly chain,\nClass'd among creatures, when the soul can flee,\nAnd with the sky, the peak, the heaving plain\nOf ocean, or the stars, mingle, and not in vain.\n\nLXXIII.\n\nAnd thus I am absorb'd, and this is life:\nI look upon the peopled desart past,\nAs on a place of agony and strife,\nWhere, for some sin, to Sorrow I was cast,\nTo act and suffer, but remount at last\nWith a fresh pinion; which I feel to spring,\nThough young, yet waxing vigorous, as the blast\nWhich it would cope with, on delighted wing,\nSpurning the clay-cold bonds with round our being cling.\n\nLXXIV.\n\nAnd when, at length, the mind shall all be free\nFrom what it hates in this degraded form,\nReft of its carnal life, save what shall be\nExistent happier in the fly and worm,--\nWhen elements to elements conform,\nAnd dust is as it should be, shall I note\nFeel all I see, less dazzling, but more warm?\n\nThe bodiless thought?\n\nthe Spirit of each spot?\n\nOf which, even now, I share at times the immortal lot?\n\nLXXV.\n\nAre not the mountains, waves, and skies, a part\nOf me and of my soul, as I of them?\n\nIs not the love of these deep in my heart\nWith a pure passion?\n\nshould I not contemn\nAll objects, if compared with these?\n\nand stem\nA tide of suffering, rather than forego\nSuch feelings for the hard and worldly phlegm\nOf those whose eyes are only turn'd below,\nGazing upon the ground, with thoughts which dare not glow?\n\nLXXVI.\n\nBut this is not my theme; and I return\nTo that which is immediate, and require\nThose who find contemplation in the urn,\nTo look on One, whose dust was once all fire,\nA native of the land where I respire\nThe clear air for a while--a passing guest,\nWhere he became a being,--whose desire\nWas to be glorious; 'twas a foolish quest,\nThe which to gain and keep, he sacrificied all rest.\n\nLXXVII.\n\nHere the self-torturing sophist, wild Rousseau,\nThe apostle of affliction, he who threw\nEnchantment over passion, and from woe\nWrung overwhelming eloquence, first drew\nThe breath which made him wretched; yet he knew\nHow to make madness beautiful, and cast\nO'er erring deeds and thoughts, a heavenly hue\nOf words, like sunbeams, dazzling as they past\nThe eyes, which o'er them shed tears feelingly and fast.\n\nLXXVIII.\n\nHis love was passion's essence--as a tree\nOn fire by lightning; with ethereal flame\nKindled he was, and blasted; for to be\nThus, and enamoured, were in him the same.\n\nBut his was not the love of living dame,\nNor of the dead who rise upon our dreams\nBut of ideal beauty, which became\nIn him existence, and o'erflowering teems\nAlong his burning page, distempered though it seems\nLXXIX.\n\nThis breathed itself to life in J\u00falie, this\nInvested her with all that's wild and sweet;\nThis hallowed, too, the memorable kiss\nWhich every morn his fevered lip would greet,\nFrom hers, who but with friendship his would meet;\nBut to that gentle touch, through brain and breast\nFlash'd the thrill'd spirit's love-devouring heat;\nIn that absorbing sigh perchance more blest,\nThan vulgar minds may be with all they seek possest.\n\nLXXX.\n\nHis life was one long war with self-sought foes,\nOr friends by him self-banish'd; for his mind\nHad grown Suspicion's sanctuary, and chose\nFor its own cruel sacrifice, the kind,\n'Gainst whom he raged with fury strange and blind.\n\nBut he was phrenzied,--wherefore, who may know?\n\nSince cause might be which skill could never find;\nBut he was phrenzied by disease or woe,\nTo that worst pitch of all, which wears a reasoning show.\n\nLXXXI.\n\nFor then he was inspired, and from him came,\nAs from the Pythian's mystic cave of your,\nThose oracles which set the world in flame,\nNor ceased to burn till kingdoms were no more:\nDid he not this for France?\n\nwhich lay before\nBowed to the inborn tyranny of years?\n\nBroken and trembling, to the yoke she bore,\nTill by the voice of him and his compeers,\nRoused up too much wrath which follows o'ergrown fears?\n\nLXXXII.\n\nThey made themselves a fearful monument!\nThe wreck of old opinions--things which grew\nBreathed from the birth of time: the veil they rent,\nAnd what behind it lay, all earth shall view.\n\nBut good with ill they also overthrew,\nLeaving but ruins, wherewith to rebuild\nUpon the same foundation, and renew\nDungeons and thrones, which the same hour re-fill'd,\nAs heretofore, because ambitio was self-will'd.\n\nLXXXIII.\n\nBut this will not endure, nor be endured!\nMankind have felt their strength, and made it felt.\n\nThey might have used it better, but, allured\nBy their new vigour, sternly have they dealt\nOn one another; pity ceased to melt\nWith her once natural charities.\n\nBut they,\nWho in oppression's darkness caved had dwelt,\nThey were not eagles, nourish'd with the day;\nWhat marvel then, at times, if they mistook their prey?\n\nLXXXIV.\n\nWhat deep wounds ever closed without a scar?\n\nThe heart's bleed longest, and but heal to wear\nThat which disfigures it; and they who war\nWith their own hopes, and have been vanquish'd, bear\nSilence, but not submission: in his lair\nFix'd Passion holds his breath, until the hour\nWhich shall atone for years; none need despair:\nIt came, it cometh, and will come,--the power\nTo punish or forgive--in one we shall be slower.\n\nLXXXV.\n\nClear, placid Leman! thy contrasted lake,\nWith the wild world I dwelt in, is a thing\nWhich warns me, with its stillness, to forsake\nEarth's troubled waters for a purer spring.\n\nThis quiet sail is as a noiseless wing\nTo waft me from distraction; once I loved\nTorn ocean's roar, but thy soft murmuring\nSounds sweet as if a sister's voice reproved,\nThat I with stern delights should e'er have been so moved.\n\nLXXXVI.\n\nIt is the hush of night, and all between\nThy margin and the mountains, dusk, yet clear,\nMellowed and mingling, yet distinctly seen,\nSave darken'd Jura, whose capt heights appear\nPrecipitously steep; and drawing near,\nThere breathes a living fragrance from the shore,\nOf flowers yet fresh with childhood; on the ear\nDrops the light drip of the suspended oar,\nOr chirps the grasshopped one good-night carol more;\nLXXXVII.\n\nHe is an evening reveller, who makes\nHis life an infancy, and sings his fill;\nAt intervals, some bird from out the brakes,\nStarts into voice a moment, then is still.\n\nThere seems a floating whisper on the hill,\nBut that is fancy, for the starlight dews\nAll silently their tears of love instil,\nWeeping themselves away, till they infuse\nDeep into Nature's breast the spirit of her hues.\n\nLXXXVIII.\n\nYe stars! which are the poetry of heaven!\nIf in your bright leaves we would read the fate\nOf men and empires,--'tis to be forgiven,\nThat in our aspirations to be great,\nOur destinies o'erleap their mortal state,\nAnd claim a kindred with you; for ye are\nA beauty and a mystery, and create\nIn us such love and reverence from afar,\nThat fortune, fame, power, life, have named themselves a star.\n\nLXXXIX.\n\nAll heaven and earth are still--though not in sleep,\nBut breathless, as we grow when feeling most;\nAnd silent, as we stand in thoughts too deep:--\nAll heaven and earth are still: From the high host\nOf stars, to the lull'd lake and mountain-coast,\nAll is concentered in a life intense,\nWhere not a beam, nor air, nor leaf is lost,\nBut hath a part of beings, and a sense\nOf that which is of all Creator and defence.\n\nXC.\n\nThen stirs the feeling infinite, so felt\nIn solitude, where we are least alone;\nA truth, which through our being then doth melt\nAnd purifies from self: it is a tone,\nThe soul and source of music, which makes known\nEternal harmony, and sheds a charm,\nLike to the fabled Cytherea's zone,\nBinding all things with beauty;--'twould disarm\nThe spectre Death, had he substantial power to harm.\n\nXCI.\n\nNot vainly did the early Persian make\nHis altar the high places and the peak\nOf earth-o'ergazing mountains, and thus take\nA fit and unwall'd temple, there to seek\nThe Spirit, in whose honour shrines are weak,\nUprear'd of human hands.\n\nCome, and compare\nColumns and idol-dwellings, Goth or Greek,\nWith Nature's realms of worship, earth and air,\nNor fix on fond abodes to circumscribe thy prayer!\nXCII.\n\nThe sky is changed!--and such a change! Oh night,\nAnd storm, and darkness, ye are wondrous strong,\nYet lovely in your strength, as is the light\nOf a dark eye in woman! Far along,\nFrom peak to peak, the rattling crags among\nLeaps the live thunder! Not from one lone cloud,\nBut every mountain now hath found a tongue,\nAnd Jura answers, through her misty shroud,\nBack to the joyous Alps, who call to her aloud!\nXCIII.\n\nAnd this is in the night:--Most glorious night!\nThou wert not sent for slumber! let me be\nA sharer in thy fierce and far delight,--\nA portion of the tempest and of thee!\nHow the lit lake shines, a phosphoric sea,\nAnd the big rain comes dancing to the earth!\nAnd now again 'tis black,--and now, the glee\nOf the loud hills shakes with its mountain-mirth,\nAs if they did rejoice o'er a young earthquake's birth.\n\nXCIV.\n\nNow, where the swift Rhone cleaves his way between\nHeights which appear as lovers who have parted\nIn hate, whose mining depths so intervene,\nThat they can meet no more, though broken-hearted;\nThough in their souls, which thus each other thwarted,\nLove was the very root of the fond rage\nWhich blighted their life's bloom, and then departed:--\nItself expired, but leaving them an age\nOf years all winters,--war within themselves to wage.\n\nXCV.\n\nNow, where the quick Rhone thus hath cleft his way,\nThe mightiest of the storms hath ta'en his stand:\nFor here, not one, but many, make their play,\nAnd fling their thunder-bolts from hand to hand,\nFlashinig and cast around: of all the band,\nThe brightest throught these parted hills hath fork'd\nHis lightnings,--as if he did understand,\nThat in such gaps as desolation work'd,\nThere the hot shaft should blast whatever therein lurk'd.\n\nXCVI.\n\nSky, mountains, river, winds, lake, lightnings! ye!\nWith night, and clouds, and thunder, and a soul\nTo make these felt and feeling, well may be\nThings that have made me watchful; the far rool\nOf your departing voices, is the knoll\nOf what in me is sleepless,--if I rest.\n\nBut where of ye, oh tempests! is the goal?\n\nAre ye like those within the human breast?\n\nOr do ye find, at length, like eagles, some high nest?\n\nXCVII.\n\nCould I embody and unbosom now\nThat which is most within me,--could I wreak\nMy thoughts upon expression, and thus throw\nSoul, heart, mind, passions, feelings, strong or weak,\nAll that I would have sought, and all I seek,\nBear, know, feel, and yet breath--into one word,\nAnd that one word were Lightning, I would speak;\nBut as it is, I live and die unheard,\nWith a most voiceless thought, sheathing it as a sword.\n\nXCVIII.\n\nThe morn is up again, the dewy morn,\nWith breath all incense, and with cheek all bloom,\nLaughing the clouds away with playful scorn,\nAnd living as if earth contain'd no tomb,--\nAnd glowing into day: we may resume\nThe march of our existence: and thus I,\nStill on thy shores, fair Leman! may find room\nAnd food for meditation, nor pass by\nMuch, that may give us pause, if pondered fittingly.\n\nXCIX.\n\nClarens! sweet Clarens, birth-place of deep Love!\nThine air is the young breath of passionate thought;\nThy trees take root in Love; the snows above\nThe very Glaciers have his colours caught,\nAnd sun-set into rose-hues sees them wrought\nBy rays which sleep there lovingly: the rocks,\nThe permanent crags, tell here of Love, who sought\nIn them a refuge from the worldly shocks,\nWhich stir and sting the soul with hope that woos, then mocks.\n\nC.\n\nClarens! by heavenly feet thy paths are trod,--\nUndying Love's who here ascends a throne\nTo which the steps are mountains; where the god\nIs a pervading life and light,--so shown\nNot on those summits solely, nor alone\nIn the still cave and forest: o'er the flower\nHis eye is sparkling, and his breath hath blown,\nHis soft and summer breath, whose tender power\nPasses the strength of storms in their most desolate hour.\n\nCI.\n\nAll things are here of him; from the black pines,\nWhich are his shade on high, and the loud roar\nOf torrents, where he listeneth, to the vines\nWhich slope his green path downward to the shore,\nWhere the bowed waters meet him, and adore,\nKissing his feet with murmurs; and the wood,\nThe covert of old trees, with trunks all hoar,\nBut light leaves, young as joy, stands were it stood,\nOffering to him, and his, a populous solitude,\nCII.\n\nA populous solitude of bees and birds,\nAnd fairy form'd and many coloured things,\nWho worship him with notes more sweet than words,\nAnd innocently open their glad wings,\nFearless and full of life: the gush of springs,\nAnd fall of lofty fountains, and the bend\nOf stirring brances, and the bud which brings\nThe swiftest thought of beauty, here extend,\nMingling, and made by Love, unto one mighty end.\n\nCIII.\n\nHe who hath loved not, here would learn that lore,\nAnd make his heart a spirit; he who knows\nThat tender mystery, will love the more,\nFor this is Love's recess, where vain men's woes,\nAnd the world's waste, have driven him far from those,\nFor 'tis his nature to advance or die;\nHe stands not still, but or decays, or grows\nInto a boundless blessing, which may vie\nWith the immortal lights, in its eternity!\nCIV.\n\n'Twas not for fiction chose Rousseau this spot,\nPeopling it with affections; but he found\nIt was the scene which passio nmust allot\nTo the mind's purifed beings; 'twas the ground\nWhere early Love his Psyche's zone unbound,\nAnd hallowed it with loveliness: 'tis ne,\nAnd wonderful, and deep, and hath a sound,\nAnd sense, and sight of sweetness; here the Rhone\nHath spread himself a couch, the Alps have rear'd a throne.\n\nCV.\n\nLausanne! and Ferney! ye have been the abodes\nOf names which unto you bequeath'd a name;\nMortals, who sought and found, by dangerous roads,\nA path to perpetuity of fame:\nThey were gigantic minds, and their steep aim,\nWas, Titan-like, on daring doubts to pile\nThoughts which should call down thunder, and the flame\nOf Heaven, again assail'd, if Heaven the while\nOn man and man's research could deign to more than smile.\n\nCVI.\n\nThe one was fire and fickleness, a child,\nMost mutable in wishes, but in mind,\nA wit as various,--gay, grave, sage, or wild,--\nHistorian, board, philosopher, combined;\nHe multiplied himself among mankind,\nThe Proteus of their talents: But his own\nBreathed most in ridicult,--which, as the wind,\nBlew where it listed, laying all things prine,--\nNow to o'erthrow a fool, and now to shake a throne.\n\nCVII.\n\nThe other, deep and slow, exhausting thought,\nAnd hiving wisdom with each studious year,\nIn meditation dwelt, with learning wrought,\nAnd shaped his weapon with an edge severe,\nSapping a solemn creed with solemn sneer;\nThe lord of irony,--that master-spell,\nWhich stung his foes to wrath, which grew from fear,\nAnd doom'd him to the zealot's ready Hell,\nWhich answers to all doubts so eloquently well.\n\nCVIII.\n\nYet, peace be with their ashes,--for by them,\nIf merited, the penalty is paid;\nIt is not ours to judge,--far less condemn;\nThe hour must come when such things shall be made\nKnown unto all,--or hope and dread allay'd\nBy slumber, on one pillow,--in the dust,\nWhich, thus much we are sure, must lie decay'd;\nAnd when it shall revive, as is our trust,\n'Twill be to be forgiven, or suffer what is just.\n\nCIX.\n\nBut let me quit man's works, again to read\nHis Maker's, spread around me, and suspend\nThis page, which from my reveries I feed,\nUntil it seems prolonging without end.\n\nThe clouds above me to the white Alps tend,\nAnd I must pierce them, and survey whate'er\nMay be permitted, as my steps I bend\nTo their most great and growing region, where\nThe earth to her embrace compels the powers of air.\n\nCX.\n\nItalia! too, Italia! looking on thee,\nFull flashes on the soul the light of ages,\nSince the fierce Carthaginian almost won thee,\nTO the last halo of the chiefs and sages,\nWho glorify thy consecrated pages;\nThou wert the throne and grave of empires; still,\nThe fount at which the panting mind assuages\nHer thirst for knowledge, quaffing there her fill,\nFlowers from the eternal source of Rome's imperial hill.\n\nCXI.\n\nThus far I have proceeded in a theme\nRenewed with no kind auspices:--to feel\nWe are not what we have been, and to deem\nWe are not what we should be,--and to steel\nThe heart against itself; and to conceal,\nWith a proud caution, love, or hate, or aught,--\nPassion or feeling, purpose, grief or zeal,--\nWhich is the tyrant spirit of our thought,\nIs a stern task of soul:--No matter,--it is taught.\n\nCXII.\n\nAnd for these words, thus woven into song,\nIt may be that they are a harmless wile,--\nThe colouring of the scenes which fleet along,\nWhich I would seize, in passing, to beguile\nMy breast, or that of others, for a while.\n\nFame is the thirst of youth,--but I am not\nSo young as to regard men's frown or smile,\nAs loss or guerdon of a glorious lot;\nI stood and stand alone,--remembered or forgot.\n\nCXIII.\n\nI have not loved the world, nor the world me;\nI have not flattered its rank breath, nor bow'd\nTo its idolatries a patient knee,--\nNor coin'd my cheek to smiles,--nor cried aloud\nIn worship of an echo; in the crowd\nThey could not deem me one of such; I stood\nAmong them, but not of them; in a shroud\nOf thoughts which were not their thoughts, and still could,\nHad I not filed my mind, which thus itself subdued.\n\nCXIV.\n\nI have not loved the world, nor the world me,--\nBut let us part fair foes; I do believe,\nThough I have found them not, that there may be\nWords which are things,--hopes which will not deceive,\nAnd virtues which are merciful, nor weave\nSnares for the failing: I would also deem\nO'er others' griefs that some sincerely grieve;\nThat two, or one, are almost what the seem,--\nThat goodness is no name, and happiness no dream.\n\nCXV.\n\nMy daughter! with thy name this song begun--\nMy daughter! with thy name thus much shall end--\nI see thee not,--I hear thee not,--but none\nCan be so wrapt in thee; thou art the friend\nTo whom the shadows of far years extend:\nAlbeit my brow thou never should'st behold,\nMy voice shall with thy future visions blend,\nAnd reach into thy heart,--when mine is cold,--\nA token and a tone, even from thy father's mould.\n\nCXVI.\n\nTo aid thy mind's development,--to watch\nThy dawn of litle joys,--to sit and see\nAlmost thy very growth,--to view thee catch\nKnowledge of objects,--wonders yet to thee!\nTo hold thee lightly on a gentle knee,\nAnd print on thy soft cheek a parent's kiss,--\nThsi, it should seem, was not reserv'd for me;\nYet this was in my nature:--as it is,\nI know not what is there, yet something like to this.\n\nCXVII.\n\nYet, though dull Hate as duty should be taught,\nI know that thou wilt love me; though my name\nShould be shut from thee, as a spell still fraught\nWith desolation,--and a broken claim:\nThough the grave closed between us,--'twere the same,\nI know that thou wilt love me; thought to drain\nMy blood from out thy being, were an aim,\nAnd an attainment,--all would be in vain,--\nStill thou would'st love me, still that more than life retain.\n\nCXVIII.\n\nThe child of love,--though born in bitterness,\nAnd nurtured in convulsion,--of thy sire\nThese were the elements,--and thine no less.\n\nAs yet such are around thee,--but thy fire\nShall be more tempered, and thy hope far higher.\n\nSweet be thy cradled slumbers!

though all were o'er,\nFor us repeopl'd were the solitary shore.\n\nV.\n\nThe beings of the mind are not of clay;\nEssentially immortal, they create\nAnd multiply in us a brighter ray\nAnd more belov'd existence: that which Fate\nProhibits to dull life, in this our state\nOf mortal bondage, by these spirits supplied,\nFirst exiles, then replaces what we hate;\nWatering the heart whose early flowers have died,\nAnd with a fresher growth replenishing the void.\n\nVI.\n\nSuch is the refuge of our youth and age,\nThe first from Hope, the last from Vacancy;\nAnd this worn feeling peoples many a page,\nAnd, maybe, that which grows beneath mine eye:\nYet there are things whose strong reality\nOutshines our fairy-land; in shape and hues\nMore beautiful than our fantastic sky,\nAnd the strange constellations which the Muse\nO'er her wild universe is skilful to diffuse:\nVII.\n\nI saw or dream'd of such -- but let them go;\nThey came like truth -- and disappear'd like dreams;\nAnd whatsoe'er they were -- are now but so:\nI could replace them if I would; still teems\nMy mind with many a form which aptly seems\nSuch as I sought for, and at moments found;\nLet these too go -- for waking Reason deems\nSuch overweening fantasies unsound,\nAnd other voices speak, and other sights surround.\n\nVIII.\n\nI've taught me other tongues, and in strange eyes\nHave made me not a stranger; to the mind\nWhich is itself, no changes bring surprise;\nNor is it harsh to make, nor hard to find\nA country with -- ay, or without mankind;\nYet was I born where men are proud to be --\nNot without cause; and should I leave behind\nThe inviolate island of the sage and free,\nAnd seek me out a home by a remoter sea,\nIX.\n\nPerhaps I lov'd it well: and should I lay\nMy ashes in a soil which is not mine,\nMy spirit shall resume it -- if we may\nUnbodied choose a sanctuary.\n\nI twine\nMy hopes of being remember'd in my line\nWith my land's language: if too fond and far\nThese aspirations in their scope incline,\nIf my fame should be, as my fortunes are,\nOf hasty growth and blight, and dull Oblivion bar\nX.\n\nMy name from out the temple where the dead\nAre honour'd by the nations -- let it be --\nAnd light the laurels on a loftier head!\nAnd be the Spartan's epitaph on me --\n\"Sparta hath many a worthier son than he.\n\nMeantime I seek no sympathies, nor need;\nThe thorns which I have reap'd are of the tree\nI planted: they have torn me, and I bleed:\nI should have known what fruit would spring from such a seed.\n\nXI.\n\nThe spouseless Adriatic mourns her lord;\nAnd annual marriage now no more renew'd,\nThe Bucentaur lies rotting unrestored,\nNeglected garment of her widowhood!\nSt.\n\nMark yet sees his lion where he stood\nStand, but in mockery of his wither'd power,\nOver he proud Place where an Emperor sued,\nAnd monarchs gaz'd and envied in the hour\nWhen Venice was a queen with an unequall'd dower.\n\nXII.\n\nThe Suabian sued, and now the Austrian reigns --\nAn Emperor tramples where an Emperor knelt;\nKingdoms are shrunk to provinces, and chains\nClank over sceptred cities, nations melt\nFrom power's high pinnacle, when they have felt\nThe sunshine for a while, and downward go\nLike Lauwine loosen'd from the mountain's belt;\nOh for one hour of blind old Dandolo!\nTh' octogenarian chief, Byzantium's conquering foe!\nXIII.\n\nBefore St.\n\nMark still glow his steeds of brass,\nTheir gilded collars glittering in the sun;\nBut is not Doria's menace come to pass?\n\nAre they not bridled?\n\n-- Venice, lost and won,\nHer thirteen hundred years of freedom done,\nSinks, like a sea-weed, into whence she rose!\nBetter be whelm'd beneath the waves, and shun,\nEven in destruction's depth, her foreign foes,\nFrom whom submission wrings an infamous repose.\n\nXIV.\n\nIn youth she was all glory, a new Tyre,\nHer very by-word sprung from victory,\nThe 'Planter of the Lion,' which through fire\nAnd blood she bore o'er subject earth and sea;\nThough making many slaves, herself still free,\nAnd Europe's bulwark 'gainst the Ottomite;\nWitness Troy's rival, Candia! Vouch it, ye\nImmortal waves that saw Lepanto's fight!\nFor ye are names no time nor tyranny can blight.\n\nXV.\n\nStatues of glass -- all shiver'd -- the long file\nOf her dead Doges are declin'd to dust;\nBut where they dwelt, the vast and sumptuous pile\nBespeaks the pageant of their splendid trust;\nTheir sceptre broken, and their sword in rust,\nHave yielded to the stranger: empty halls,\nThin streets, and foreign aspects, such as must\nToo oft remind her who and what enthralls,\nHave flung a desolate cloud o'er Venice' lovely walls.\n\nXVI.\n\nWhen Athens' armies fell at Syracuse,\nAnd fetter'd thousands bore the yoke of war,\nRedemption rose up in the Attic Muse,\nHer voice their only ransom from afar:\nSee! as they chant the tragic hymn, the car\nOf the o'ermaster'd victor stops, the reins\nFall from his hands -- his idle scimitar\nStarts from its belt -- he rends his captive's chains,\nAnd bids him thank the bard for freedom and his strains.\n\nXVII.\n\nThus, Venice! if no stronger claim were thine,\nWere all thy proud historic deeds forgot,\nThy choral memory of the Bard divine,\nThy love of Tasso, should have cut the knot\nWhich ties thee to thy tyrants; and thy lot\nIs shameful to the nations -- most of all,\nAlbion, to thee: the Ocean queen should not\nAbandon Ocean's children; in the fall\nOf Venice think of thine, despite thy watery wall.\n\nXVIII.\n\nI loved her from my boyhood; she to me\nWas as a fairy city of the heart,\nRising like water-columns from the sea,\nOf joy the sojourn, and of wealth the mart;\nAnd Otway, Radcliffe, Schiller, Shakespeare's art,\nHad stamp'd her image in me, and even so,\nAlthough I found her thus, we did not part;\nPerchance even dearer in her day of woe,\nThan when she was a boast, a marvel, and a show.\n\nXIX.\n\nI can repeople with the past -- and of\nThe present there is still for eye and thought,\nAnd meditation chasten'd down, enough;\nAnd more, it may be, than I hoped or sought;\nAnd of the happiest moments which were wrought\nWithin the web of my existence, some\nFrom thee, fair Venice! have their colours caught:\nThere are some feelings Time cannot benumb,\nNor Torture shake, or mine would now be cold and dumb.\n\nXX.\n\nBut from their nature will the Tannen grow\nLoftiest on loftiest and least shelter'd rocks,\nRooted in barrenness, where nought below\nOf soil supports them 'gainst the Alpine shocks\nOf eddying storms; yet springs the trunk, and mocks\nThe howling tempest, till its height and frame\nAre worthy of the mountains from whose blocks\nOf bleak, gray granite into life it came,\nAnd grew a giant tree; -- the mind may grow the same.\n\nXXI\nExistence may be borne, and the deep root\nOf life and sufferance make its firm abode\nThe bare and desolated bosoms: mute\nThe camel labours with the heaviest load,\nAnd the wolf dies in silence, -- not bestow'd\nIn vain should such example be; if they,\nThings of ignoble or of savage mood,\nEndure and shrink not, we of nobler clay\nMay temper it to bear, -- it is but for a day.\n\nXXII\nAll suffering doth destroy, or is destroy'd,\nEven by the sufferer; and, in each event,\nEnds: -- Some, with hope replenish'd and rebuoy'd,\nReturn to whence they came -- with like intent,\nAnd weave their web again; some, bow'd and bent,\nWax gray and ghastly, withering ere their time,\nAnd perish with the reed on which they leant;\nSome seek devotion, toil, war, good or crime,\nAccording as their souls were form'd to sink or climb.\n\nXXIII\nBut ever and anon of griefs subdued\nThere comes a token like a scorpion's sting,\nScarce seen, but with fresh bitterness imbued;\nAnd slight withal may be the things which bring\nBack on the heart the weight which it would fling\nAside for ever: it may be a sound --\nA tone of music -- summer's eve -- or spring --\nA flower -- the wind -- the ocean -- which shall wound,\nStriking the electric chain wherewith we are darkly bound;\nXXIV\nAnd how and why we know not, nor can trace\nHome to its cloud this lightning of the mind,\nBut feel the shock renew'd, nor can efface\nThe blight and blackening which it leaves behind,\nWhich out of things familiar, undesign'd,\nWhen least we deem of such, calls up to view\nThe spectres whom no exorcism can bind, --\nThe cold, the changed, perchance the dead -- anew,\nThe mourn'd, the loved, the lost -- too many! yet how few!\nXXV\nBut my soul wanders: I demand it back\nTo meditate amongst decay, and stand\nA ruin amidst ruins; there to track\nFall'n states and buried greatness, o'er a land\nWhich was the mightiest in its old command,\nAnd is the loveliest, and must ever be\nThe master mould of Nature's heavenly hand;\nWherein were cast the heroic and the free,\nThe beautiful, the brave, the lords of earth and sea,\nXXVI\nThe commonwealth of kings, the men of Rome!\nAnd even since, and now, fair Italy!\nThou art the garden of the world, the home\nOf all Art yields, and Nature can decree;\nEven in thy desert, what is like to thee?\n\nThy very weeds are beautiful, thy waste\nMore rich than other climes' fertility;\nThy wreck a glory, and thy ruin graced\nWith an immaculate charm which cannot be defaced.\n\nXXVII\nThe moon is up, and yet it is not night;\nSunset divides the sky with her; a sea\nOf glory streams along the Alpine height\nOf blue Friuli's mountains; Heaven is free\nFrom clouds, but of all colours seems to be, --\nMelted to one vast Iris of the West, --\nWhere the Day joins the past Eternity,\nWhile, on the other hand, meek Dian's crest\nFloats through the azure air -- an island of the blest!\nXXVIII\nA single star is at her side, and reigns\nWith her o'er half the lovely heaven; but still\nYon sunny sea heaves brightly, and remains\nRoll'd o'er the peak of the far Rh\u00e6tian hill,\nAs Day and Night contending were, until\nNature reclaim'd her order: -- gently flows\nThe deep-dyed Brenta, where their hues instil\nThe odorous purple of a new-born rose,\nWhich streams upon her stream, and glass'd within it glows,\nXXIX\nFill'd with the face of heaven, which, from afar,\nComes down upon the waters; all its hues,\nFrom the rich sunset to the rising star,\nTheir magical variety diffuse:\nAnd now they change; a paler shadow strews\nIts mantle o'er the mountains; parting day\nDies like the dolphin, whom each pang imbues\nWith a new colour as it gasps away --\nThe last still loveliest, -- till -- 'tis gone -- and all is gray.\n\nXXX\nThere is a tomb at Arqua; -- rear'd in air,\nPillar'd in their sarcophagus, repose\nThe bones of Laura's lover: here repair\nMany familiar with his well-sung woes,\nThe pilgrims of his genius.\n\nHe arose\nTo raise a language, and his land reclaim\nFrom the dull yoke of her barbaric foes:\nWatering the tree which bears his lady's name\nWith his melodious tears, he gave himself to fame.\n\nXXXI\nThey keep his dust in Arqua, where he died;\nThe mountain-village where his latter days\nWent down the vale of years; and 'tis their pride --\nAn honest pride -- and let it be their praise,\nTo offer to the passing stranger's gaze\nHis mansion and his sepulchre; both plain\nAnd venerably simple, such as raise\nA feeling more accordant with his train\nThan if a pyramid form'd his monumental fane.\n\nXXXII\nAnd the soft quiet hamlet where he dwelt\nIs one of that complexion which seems made\nFor those who their mortality have felt,\nAnd sought a refuge from their hopes decay'd\nIn the deep umbrage of a green hill's shade,\nWhich shows a distant prospect far away\nOf busy cities, now in vain display'd,\nFor they can lure no further; and the ray\nOf a bright sun can make sufficient holiday,\nXXXIII\nDeveloping the mountains, leaves, and flowers,\nAnd shining in the brawling brook, whereby,\nClear as its current, glide the sauntering hours\nWith a calm languor, which, though to the eye\nIdlesse it seem, hath its mortality.\n\nIf from society we learn to live,\n'Tis solitude should teach us how to die;\nIt hath no flatters; vanity can give\nNo hollow aid; alone -- man with his God must strive:\nXXXIV\nOr, it may be, with demons, who impair\nThe strength of better thoughts, and seek their prey\nIn melancholy bosoms, such as were\nOf moody texture, from their earliest day,\nAnd loved to dwell in darkness and dismay,\nDeeming themselves predestined to a doom\nWhich is not of the pangs that pass away;\nMaking the sun like blood, the earth a tomb,\nThe tomb a hell, and hell itself a murkier gloom.\n\nXXXV\nFerrara! in thy wide and grass-grown streets,\nWhose symmetry was not for solitude,\nThere seems as 'twere a curse upon the seats\nOf former sovereigns, and the antique brood\nOf Este, which for many an age made good\nIts strength within thy walls, ad was of yore\nPatron or tyrant, as the changing mood\nOf petty power impell'd, of those who wore\nThe wreath which Dante's brow alone had worn before.\n\nXXXVI\nAnd Tasso is their glory and their shame.\n\nHark to his strain! and then survey his cell!\nAnd see how dearly earn'd Torquato's fame,\nAnd where Alfonso bade his poet dwell:\nThe miserable despot could not quell\nThe insulted mind he sought to quench, and blend\nWith the surrounding maniacs, in the hell\nWhere he had plunged it.\n\nGlory without end\nScatter'd the clouds away; and on that name attend\nXXXVII\nThe tears and praises of all time; while thine\nWould rot in its oblivion -- in the sink\nOf worthless dust, which from thy boasted line\nIs shaken into nothing -- but the link\nThou formest in his fortunes bids us think\nOf thy poor malice, naming thee with scorn:\nAlfonso! how thy ducal pageants shrink\nFrom thee! if in another station born,\nScarce fit to be the slave of him thou madest to mourn:\nXXXVIII\nThou! form'd to eat, and be despised, and die,\nEven as the beasts that perish, save that thou\nHadst a more splendid trough and wider sty:\nHe! with a glory round his furrow'd brow,\nWhich emanated then, and dazzles now,\nIn face of all his foes, the Cruscan quire,\nAnd Boileau, whose rash envy could allow\nNo strain which shamed his country's creaking lyre,\nThat whetstone of the teeth -- monotony in wire!\nXXXIX\nPeace to Torquato's injured shade! twas his\nIn life and death to be the mark where Wrong\nAim'd with her poison'd arrows, but to miss.\n\nO, victor unsurpass'd in modern song!\nEach year brings forth its millions; but how long\nThe tide of generations shall roll on,\nAnd not the whole combined and countless throng\nCompose a mind like thine?\n\nthough all in one\nCondensed their scatter'd rays, they would not form a sun.\n\nXL\nGreat as thou art, yet parallel'd by those,\nThy countrymen, before thee born to shine,\nThe Bards of Hell and Chivalry: first rose\nThe Tuscan father's Comedy Divine;\nThen, not unequal to the Florentine,\nThe southern Scott, the minstrel who call'd forth\nA new creation with his magic line,\nAnd, like the Ariosto of the North,\nSang ladye-love and war, romance and knightly worth.\n\nXLI\nThe lightning rent from Ariosto's bust\nThe iron crown of laurel's mimick'd leaves;\nNor was the ominous element unjust\nFor the true laurel-wreath which Glory weaves\nIs of the tree no bolt of thunder cleaves,\nAnd the false semblance but disgraced his brow;\nYet still, if fondly Superstition grieves,\nKnow, that the lightning sanctifies below\nWhate'er it strikes; -- yon head is doubly sacred now.\n\nXLII\nItalia! oh Italia! thou who hast\nThe fatal gift of beauty, which became\nA funeral dower of present woes and past,\nOn thy sweet brow is sorrow plough'd by shame,\nAnd annals graved in characters of flame.\n\nOh, God! that thou wert in thy nakedness\nLess lovely or more powerful, and couldst claim\nThy right, and awe the robbers back, who press\nTo shed thy blood, and drink the tears of thy distress;\nXLIII\nThen might'st thou more appal; or, less desired,\nBe homely and be peaceful, undeplored\nFor thy destructive charms; then, still untired,\nWould not be seen the armed torrents pour'd\nDown the deep Alps; nor would the hostile horde\nOf many-nation'd spoilers from the Po\nQuaff blood and water; nor the stranger's sword\nBe thy sad weapon of defence, and so,\nVictor or vanquish'd, thou the slave of friend or foe.\n\nXLIV\nWandering in youth, I traced the path of him,\nThe Roman friend of Rome's least-mortal mind,\nThe friend of Tully: as my bark did skim\nThe bright blue waters with a fanning wind,\nCame Megara before me, and behind\n\u00c6gina lay, Pir\u00e6us on the right,\nAnd Corinth on the left; I lay reclined\nAlong the prow, and saw all these unite\nIn ruin, even as he had seen the desolate sight;\nXLV\nFor Time hath not rebuilt them, but uprear'd\nBarbaric dwellings on their shatter'd site,\nWhich only make more mourn'd and more endear'd\nThe few last rays of their far-scatter'd light,\nAnd the crush'd relics of their vanish'd might.\n\nThe Roman saw these tombs in his own age,\nThese sepulchres of cities, which excite\nSad wonder, and his yet surviving page\nThe moral lesson bears, drawn from such pilgrimage.\n\nXLVI\nThat page is now before me, and on mine\nHis country's ruin added to the mass\nOf perish'd states he mourn'd in their decline,\nAnd I in desolation: all that was\nOf then destruction is; and now, alas!\nRome -- Rome imperial, bows her to the storm,\nIn the same dust and blackness, and we pass\nThe skeleton of her Titanic form,\nWrecks of another world, whose ashes still are warm.\n\nXLVII\nYet, Italy! through every other land\nThy wrongs should ring, and shall, from side to side;\nMother of Arts! as once of arms; thy hand\nWas then our guardian, and is still our guide;\nParent of our religion! whom the wide\nNations have knelt to for the keys of heaven!\nEurope, repentent of her parricide,\nShall yet redeem thee, and, all backward driven,\nRoll the barbarian tide, and sue to be forgiven.\n\nXLVIII\nBut Arno wins us to the fair white walls,\nWhere the Etrurian Athens claims and keeps\nA softer feeling for her fairy halls.\n\nGirt by her theatre of hills, she reaps\nHer corn, and wine, and oil, and Plenty leaps\nTo laughing life, with her redundant horn.\n\nAlong the banks where smiling Arno sweeps\nWas modern Luxury of Commerce born,\nAnd buried Learning rose, redeem'd to new morn.\n\nXLIX\nThere, too, the Goddess loves in stone, and fills\nThe air around with beauty; we inhale\nThe ambrosial aspect, which, beheld, instils\nPart of its immortality; the veil\nOf heaven is half undrawn; within the pale\nWe stand, and in that form and face behold\nWhat Mind can make, when Nature's self would fail;\nAnd to the fond idolators of old\nEnvy the innate flash which such a soul could mould:\nL\nWe gaze and turn away, and know not where,\nDazzled and drunk with beauty, till the heart\nReels with its fulness; there -- for ever there --\nChain'd to the chariot of triumphal Art,\nWe stand as captives, and would not depart.\n\nAway! -- there needs no words nor terms precise,\nThe paltry jargon of the marble mart,\nWhere Pedantry gulls Folly -- we have eyes:\nBlood, pulse, and breast confirm the Dardan Shepherd's prize.\n\nLI\nAppear'dst thou not to Paris in this guise?\n\nOr to more deeply blest Anchises?\n\nor,\nIn all thy perfect Goddess-ship, when lies\nBefore thee thy own vanquish'd Lord of War?\n\nAnd gazing in thy face as toward a star,\nLaid on thy lap, his eyes to thee upturn,\nFeeding on thy sweet cheek! while thy lips are\nWith lava kisses melting while they burn,\nShower'd on his eyelids, brow, and mouth, as from an urn?\n\nLII\nGlowing, and circumfused in speechless love\nTheir full divinity inadequate\nThat feeling to express, or to improve,\nThe gods become as mortals, and man's fate\nHas moments like their brightest; but the weight\nOf earth recoils upon us; -- let it go!\nWe can recall such visions, and create,\nFrom what has been, or might be, things which grow\nInto thy statue's form, and look like gods below.\n\nLIII\nI leave to learned fingers and wise hands,\nThe artist and his ape, to teach and tell\nHow well his connoisseurship understands\nThe graceful bend, and the voluptuous swell:\nLet these describe the undescribable:\nI would not their vile breath should crisp the stream\nWherein that image shall for ever dwell;\nThe unruffled mirror of the loveliest dream\nThat ever left the sky on the deep soul to beam.\n\nLIV\nIn Santa Croce's holy precincts lie\nAshes which make it holier, dust which is\nEven in itself an immortality,\nThough there were nothing save the past, and this,\nThe particle of those sublimities\nWhich have relapsed to chaos: here repose\nAngelo's, Alfieri's bones, and his,\nThe starry Galileo, with his woes;\nHere Machiavelli's earth return'd to whence it rose.\n\nLV\nThese are four minds, which, like the elements,\nMight furnish forth creation: -- Italy!\nTime, which hath wrong'd thee with ten thousand rents\nOf thine imperal garment, shall deny,\nAnd hath denied, to every other sky,\nSpirits which soar from ruin: thy decay\nIs still impregnate with divinity,\nWhich gilds it with revivifying ray;\nSuch as the great of yore, Canova is today.\n\nLVI\nBut where repose the all Etruscan three --\nDante, and Petrarch, and, scarce less thatn they,\nThe Bard of Prose, creative spirit! he\nOf the Hundred Tales of love -- where did they lay\nTheir bones, distinguish'd from our common clay\nIn death as life?\n\nAre they resolved to dust,\nAnd have their country's marbles nought to say?\n\nCould not her quarries furnish forth one bust?\n\nDid they not to her breast their filial earth entrust?\n\nLVII\nUngrateful Florence! Dante sleeps afar,\nLike Scipio, buried by the upbraiding shore:\nThy factions, in their worse than civil war,\nProscribed the bard whose name forevermore\nTheir children's children would in vain adore\nWith the remorse of ages; and the crown\nWhich Petrarch's laureate brow supremely wore,\nUpon a far and foreign soil had grown,\nHis life, his fame, his grave, though rifled -- not thine own.\n\nLVIII\nBoccaccio to his parent earth bequeath'd\nHis dust, -- and lies it not her great among,\nWith many a sweet and solemn requiem breathed\nO'er him who form'd the Tuscan's siren tongue?\n\nThat music in itself, whose sounds are song,\nThe poetry of speech?\n\nNo; -- even his tomb\nUptorn, must bear the hy\u00e6na bigot's wrong,\nNo more amidst the meaner dead find room,\nNor claim a passing sigh, because it told for whom!\nLIX\nAnd Santa Croce wants their mighty dust;\nYet for this want more noted, as of yore\nThe C\u00e6sar's pageant, shorn of Brutus' bust,\nDid but of Rome's best Son remind her more:\nHappier Ravenna! on thy hoary shore,\nFortress of falling empire! honour'd sleeps\nThe immortal exile; -- Arqua, too her store\nOf tuneful relics proudly claims and keeps,\nWhile Florence vainly begs her banish'd dead and weeps.\n\nLX\nWhat is her pyramid of precious stones?\n\nOf porphyry, jasper, agate, and all hues\nOf gem and marble, to encrust the bones\nOf merchant-dukes?\n\nthe momentary dews\nWhich, sparkling to the twilight stars, infuse\nFreshness in the green turf that wraps the dead,\nWhose names are mausoleums of the Muse,\nAre gently prest with far more reverent tread\nThan ever paced the slab which paves the princely head.\n\nLXI\nThere be more things to greet the heart and eyes\nIn Arno's dome of Art's most princely shrine,\nWhere Sculpture with her rainbow sister vies;\nThere be more marvels yet -- but not for mine;\nFor I have been accustom'd to entwine\nMy thoughts with Nature rather in the fields,\nThan Art in galleries; though a work divine\nCalls for my spirit's homage, yet it yields\nLess than it feels, because the weapon which it wields\nLXII\nIs of another temper, and I roam\nBy Thrasimene's lake, in the defiles\nFatal to Roman rashness, more at home;\nFor there the Carthaginian's warlike wiles\nCome back before me, as his skill beguiles\nThe host between the mountains the the shore,\nWhere Courage falls in her despairing files,\nAnd torrents swoll'n to rivers with their gore,\nReek through the sultry plain, with legions scatter'd o'er,\nLXIII\nLike to a forest fell'd by mountain winds;\nAnd such the storm of battle on this day,\nAnd such the frenzy, whose convulsion blinds\nTo all save carnage, that, beneath the fray,\nAn earthquake reel'd unheededly away!\nNone felt stern Nature rocking at his feet,\nAnd yawning forth a grave for those who lay\nUpon their bucklers for a winding-sheet;\nSuch is the absorbing hate when warring nations meet!\nLXIV\nThe Earth to them was as a rolling bark\nWhich bore them to Eternity; they saw\nThe Ocean round, but had not time to mark\nThe motions of their vessel; Nature's law,\nIn them suspended, reck'd not of the awe\nWhich reigns when mountains tremble, and the birds\nPlunge in the clouds for refuge, and withdraw\nFrom their down-toppling nests; and bellowing herds\nStumble o'er heaving plains, and man's dread hath no words.\n\nLXV\nFar other scene is Thrasimene now;\nHer lake a sheet of silver, and her plain\nRent by no ravage save the gentle plough;\nHer aged trees rise thick as once the slain\nLay where their roots are; but a brook hath ta'en --\nA little rill of scanty stream and bed --\nA name of blood from that day's sanguine rain;\nAnd Sanguinetto tells ye where the dead\nMade the earth wet, and turn'd the unwilling waters red.\n\nLXVI\nBut thou, Clitumnus! in thy sweetest wave\nOf the most living crystal that was e'er\nThe haunt of river nymph, to gaze and lave\nHer limbs where nothing hid them, thou dost rear\nThy grassy banks whereon the milk-white steer\nGrazes; the purest god of gentle waters!\nAnd most serene of aspect, and most clear;\nSurely that stream was unprofaned by slaughters,\nA mirror and a bath for Beauty's youngest daughters!\nLXVII\nAnd on thy happy shore a Temple still,\nOf small and delicate proportion, keeps,\nUpon a mild declivity of hill,\nIts memory of thee; beneath it sweeps\nThy current's calmness; oft from out it leaps\nThe finny darter with the glittering scales,\nWho dwells and revels in thy glassy deeps;\nWhile, chance, some scatter'd waterlily sails\nDown were the shallower wave still tells its bubbling tales.\n\nLXVIII\nPass not unblest the Genius of the place!\nIf through the air a zephyr more serene\nWin to the brow, 'tis his; and if ye trace\nAlong his margin a more eloquent green,\nIf on the heart the freshness of the scene\nSprinkle its coolness, and from the dry dust\nOf weary life a moment lave it clean\nWith Nature's baptism, -- 'tis to him ye must\nPay orisons for this suspension of disgust.\n\nLXIX\nThe roar of waters! -- from the headlong height\nVelino cleaves the wave-worn precipice;\nThe fall of waters! rapid as the light\nThe flashing mass foams shaking the abyss;\nThe hell of waters! where they howl and hiss,\nAnd boil in endless torture; while the sweat\nOf their great agony, wrung out from this\nTheir Phlegethon, curls round the rocks of jet\nThat guard the gulf around, in pitiless horror set,\nLXX\nAnd mounts in spray the skies, and thence again\nReturns in an unceasing shower, which round,\nWith its unemptied cloud of gentle rain,\nIs an eternal April to the ground,\nMaking it all one emerald: -- how profound\nThe gulf! and how the giant element\nFrom rock to rock leaps with delirious bound,\nCrushing the cliffs, which, downward worn and rent\nWith his fierce footsteps, yields in chasms a fearful vent\nLXXI\nTo the broad column which rolls on, and shows\nMore like the fountain of an infant sea\nTorn from the womb of mountains by the throes\nOf a new world, than only thus to be\nParent of rivers, which glow gushingly,\nWith many windings, through the vale: -- Look back!\nLo! where it comes like an eternity,\nAs if to sweep down all things in its track,\nCharming the eye with dread, -- a matchless cataract,\nLXXII\nHorribly beautiful! but on the verge,\nFrom side to side, beneath the glittering morn,\nAn Iris sits, amidst the infernal surge,\nLike Hope upon a death-bed, and, unworn\nIts steady dyes, while all around is torn\nBy the distracted waters, bears serene\nIts brilliant hues with all their beams unshorn:\nResembling, 'mid the torture of the scene,\nLove watching Madness with unalterable mien.\n\nLXXIII\nOnce more upon the woody Apennine,\nThe infant Alps, which -- had I not before\nGazed on their mightier parents, where the pine\nSits on more shaggy summits, and where roar\nThe thundering Lauwine -- might be worshipp'd more;\nBut I have seen the soaring Jungfrau rear\nHer never-trodden snow, and seen the hoar\nGlaciers of bleak Mont Blanc both far and near,\nAnd in Chimari heard the thunder-hills of fear,\nLXXIV\nTh' Acroceraunian mountains of old name;\nAnd on Parnassus seen the eagles fly\nLike spirits of the spot, as 'twere for fame,\nFor still they soared unutterably high:\nI've look'd on Ida with a Trojan's eye;\nAthos, Olympus, \u00c6tna, Atlas, made\nThese hills seem things of lesser dignity,\nAll, save the lone Soracte's height, display'd\nNot now in snow, which asks the lyric Roman's aid\nLXXV\nFor our remembrance, and from out the plain\nHeaves like a long-swept wave about to break,\nAnd on the curl hangs pausing: not in vain\nMay he, who will, his recollections rake,\nAnd quote in classic raptures, and awake\nThe hills with Latian echoes; I abhorr'd\nToo much, to conquer for the poet's sake,\nThe drill'd dull lesson, forced down word by word\nIn my repugnant youth, with pleasure to record\nLXXVI\nAught that recalls the daily drug which turn'd\nMy sickening memory; and, though Time hath taught\nMy mind to meditate what then it learn'd,\nYet such the fix'd inveteracy, wrought\nBy the impatience of my early thought,\nThat with the freshness wearing out before\nMy mind could relish what it might have sought,\nIf free to choose, I cannot now restore\nIts health; but what it then detested, still abhor.\n\nLXXVII\nThen farewell, Horace; whom I hated so,\nNot for thy faults, but mine; it is a curse\nTo understand, not feel thy lyric flow,\nTo comprehend, but never love thy verse:\nAlthough no deeper Moralist rehearse\nOur little life, nor Bard prescribe his art,\nNor livelier Satirist the conscience pierce,\nAwakening without wounding the touch'd heart,\nYet fare thee well -- upon Soracte's ridge we part.\n\nLXXVIII\nOh Rome! my country! city of the soul!\nThe orphans of the heart must turn to thee,\nLone mother of dead empires! and control\nIn their shut breasts their petty misery.\n\nWhat are our woes and sufferance?\n\nCome and see\nThe cypress, hear the owl, and plod your way\nO'er steps of broken thrones and temples, Ye!\nWhose agonies are evils of day --\nA world is at our feet as fragile as our clay.\n\nLXXIX\nThe Niobe of nations! there she stands,\nChildless and crownless, in her voiceless woe;\nAn empty urn within her wither'd hands,\nWhose holy dust was scatter'd long ago;\nThe Scipios' tomb contains no ashes now;\nThe very sepulchres lie tenantless\nOf their heroic dwellers: dost thou flow,\nOld Tiber! through a marble wilderness?\n\nRise, with thy yellow waves, and mantle her distress.\n\nLXXX\nThe Goth, the Christian, Time, War, Flood, and Fire,\nHave dealt upon the seven-hill'd city's pride;\nShe saw her glories star by star expire,\nAnd up the steep barbarian monarchs ride,\nWhere the car climb'd the Capitol; far and wide\nTemple and tower went down, nor left a site:\nChaos of ruins! who shall trace the void,\nO'er the dim fragments cast a lunar light,\nAnd say, 'here was, or is,' where all is doubly night?\n\nLXXXI\nThe double night of ages, and of her,\nNight's daughter, Ignorance, hath wrapt and wrap\nAll round us: we but feel our way to err:\nThe ocean hath his chart, and stars their map,\nAnd Knowledge spreads them on her ample lap;\nBut Rome is as the desert, where we steer\nStumbling o'er recollections; now we clap\nOur hands, and cry 'Eureka!' it is clear --\nWhen but some false mirage or ruin rises near.\n\nLXXXII\nAlas! the lofty city! and alas!\nThe trebly hundred triumphs! and the day\nWhen Brutus made the dagger's edge surpass\nThe conqueror's sword in bearing fame away!\nAlas, for Tully's voice, and Virgil's lay,\nAnd Livy's pictured page!

Thou, who didst subdue\nThy country's foes ere thou wouldst pause to feel\nThe wrath of thy own wrongs, or reap the due\nOf hoarded vengeance till thine eagles flew\nO'er prostrate Asia; -- thou, who with thy frown\nAnnihilated senates -- Roman, too.\n\nWith all thy vices, for thou didst lay down\nWith an atoning smile a more than earthly crown --\nLXXXIV\nThe dictatorial wreath -- couldst thou divine\nTo what would one day dwindle that which made\nThee more than mortal?\n\nand that so supine\nBy aught than Romans Rome should thus be laid?\n\nShe who was named Eternal, and array'd\nHer warriors but to conquer -- she who veil'd\nEarth with her haughty shadow, and display'd,\nUntil the o'er-canopied horizon fail'd,\nHer rushing wings -- Oh! she who was Almighty hail'd!\nLXXXV\nSylla was first of victors; but our own,\nThe sagest of usurpers, Cromwell! -- he\nToo swept off senates while he hew'd the throne\nDown to a block -- immortal rebel! See\nWhat crimes it costs to be a moment free,\nAnd famous through all ages! but beneath\nHis fate the moral lurks of destiny;\nHis day of double victory and death\nBeheld him win two realms, and, happier, yield his breath.\n\nLXXXVI\nThe third of the same moon whose former course\nHad all but crown'd him, on the selfsame day\nDeposed him gently from his throne of force,\nAnd laid him with the earth's preceding clay.\n\nAnd show'd not Fortune thus how fame and sway,\nAnd all we deem delightful, and consume\nOur souls to compass through each arduous way,\nAre in her eyes less happy than the tomb?\n\nWere they but so in man's how different were his doom!\nLXXXVII\nAnd thou, dread statue! yet existent in\nThe austerest form of naked majesty,\nThou who beheldest, 'mid the assassins' din,\nAt thy bathed base the bloody C\u00e6sar lie,\nFolding his robe in dying dignity,\nAn offering to thine altar from the queen\nOf gods and men, great Nemesis! did he die,\nAnd thou, too, perish, Pompey?\n\nhave ye been\nVictors of countless kings, or puppets of a scene?\n\nLXXXVIII\nAnd thou, the thunder-stricken nurse of Rome!\nShe-wolf! whose brazen-imaged dugs impart\nThe milk of conquest yet within the dome\nWhere, as a monument of antique art,\nThou standest: -- Mother of the mighty heart,\nWhich the great founder suck'd from thy wild teat,\nScorch'd by the Roman Jove's ethereal dart,\nAnd thy limbs black with lightning -- dost thou yet\nGuard thine immoral cubs, nor thy fond charge forget?\n\nLXXXIX\nThou dost; but all thy foster-babes are dead --\nThe men of iron: and the world hath rear'd\nCities from out their sepulchres: men bled\nIn imitation of the things they fear'd,\nAnd fought and conquer'd, and the same course steer'd,\nAt apish distance; but as yet none have,\nNor could the same supremacy have near'd,\nSave one vain man, who is not in the grave,\nBut, vanquish'd by himself, to his own slaves a slave --\nXC\nThe fool of false dominion -- and a kind\nOf bastard C\u00e6sar, following him of old\nWith steps unequal; for the Roman's mind\nWas modell'd in a less terrestrial mould,\nWith passions fiercer, yet a judgment cold,\nAnd an immortal instinct which redeem'd\nThe frailties of a heart so soft, yet bold,\nAlcides with the distaff now he seem'd\nAt Cleopatra's feet, -- and now himself he beam'd,\nXCI\nAnd came -- and saw -- and conquer'd ! But the man\nWho would have tamed his eagles down to flee,\nLike a train'd falcon, in the Gallic van,\nWhich he, in sooth, long led to victory\nWith a deaf heart, which never seem'd to be\nA listener to itself, was strangely framed;\nWith but one weakest weakness -- vanity,\nCoquettish in ambition, still he aim'd --\nAt what?\n\ncan he avouch, or answer what he claim'd?\n\nXCII\nAnd would be all or nothing -- nor could wait\nFor the sure grave to level him; few years\nHad fix'd him with the C\u00e6sars in his fate,\nOn whom we tread; for this the conqueror rears\nThe arch of triumph and for this the tears\nAnd blood of earth flow on as they have flow'd,\nAn universal deluge, which appears\nWithout an ark for wretched man's abode,\nAnd ebbs but to reflow! Renew thy rainbow, God!\nXCIII\nWhat from this barren being do we reap?\n\nOur senses narrow, and our reason frail,\nLife short, and truth a gem which loves the deep,\nAnd all things weigh'd in custom's falsest scale;\nOpinion an omnipotence, -- whose veil\nMantles the earth with darkness, until right\nAnd wrong are accidents, and men grow pale\nLest their own judgments should become too bright,\nAnd their free thoughts be crimes, and earth have too much light.\n\nXCIV\nAnd thus they plod in sluggish misery,\nRotting from sire to son, and age to age,\nProud of their trampled nature, and so die,\nBequeathing their hereditary rage\nTo the new race of inborn slaves, who wage\nWar for their chains, and rather than be free,\nBleed gladiator-like, and still engage\nWithin the same arena where they see\nTheir fellows fall before, like leaves of the same tree.\n\nXCV\nI speak not of men's creeds -- they rest between\nMan and his Maker -- but of things allow'd,\nAverr'd, and known, and daily, hourly seen --\nThe yoke that is upon us doubly bow'd,\nAnd the intent of tyranny avow'd,\nThe edict of Earth's rulers, who are grown\nThe apes of him who humbled once the proud,\nAnd shook them from their slumbers on the throne:\nToo glorious, were this all his mighty arm had done.\n\nXCVI\nCan tyrants but by tyrants conquer'd be,\nAnd Freedom find no champion and no child\nSuch as Columbia saw arise when she\nSprung forth a Pallas, arm'd and undefiled?\n\nOr must such minds be nourish'd in the wild,\nDeep in the unpruned forest, 'midst the roar\nOf cataracts, where nursing Nature smiled\nOn infant Washington?\n\nHas Earth no more\nSuch seeds within her breast, or Europe no such shore?\n\nXCVII\nBut France got drunk with blood to vomit crime,\nAnd fatal have her Saturnalia been\nTo Freedom's cause, in every age an clime;\nBecause the deadly days which we have seen,\nAnd vile Ambition, that built up between\nMan and his hopes an adamantine wall,\nAnd the base pageant last upon the scene,\nAre grown the pretext for the eternal thrall\nWhich nips life's tree, and dooms man's worst -- his second fall.\n\nXCVIII\nYet, Freedom! yet thy banner, torn, but flying,\nStreams like the thunder-storm against the wind;\nThy trumpet voice, though broken now and dying,\nThe loudest still the tempest leaves behind;\nThy tree hath lost its blossoms, and the rind,\nChopp'd by the axe, looks rough and little worth,\nBut the sap lasts, -- and still the seed we find\nSown deep, even in the bosom of the North;\nSo shall a better spring less better fruit bring forth.\n\nXCIX\nThere is a stern round tower of other days,\nFirm as a fortress, with its fence of stone,\nSuch as an army's baffled strength delays,\nStanding with half its battlements alone,\nAnd with two thousand years of ivy grown,\nThe garland of eternity, where wave\nThe green leaves over all by time o'er thrown; --\nWhere was this tower of strength?\n\nwithin its case\nWhat treasure lay, so lock'd, so hid?\n\n-- A woman's grave.\n\nC\nBut who was she, the lady of the dead,\nTomb'd in a palace?\n\nWas she chaste and fair?\n\nWorthy a king's, or more -- a Roman's bed?\n\nWhat race of chiefs and heroes did she bear?\n\nWhat daughter of her beauties was she heir?\n\nHow lived, how loved, how died she?\n\nWas she not\nSo honoured -- and conspicuously there,\nWhere meaner relics must not dare to rot,\nPlaced to commemorate a more than mortal lot?\n\nCI\nWas she as those who love their lords, or they\nWho love the lords of others?\n\nsuch have been\nEven in the olden time, Rome's annals say.\n\nWas she a matron of Cornelia's mien,\nOr the light air of Egypt's graceful queen,\nProfuse of joy -- or 'gainst it did she war\nInveterate in virtue?\n\nDid she lean\nTo the soft side of the heart, or wisely bar\nLove from amongst her griefs?\n\n-- for such the affections are.\n\nCII\nPerchance she died in youth: it may be, bow'd\nWith woes far heavier than the ponderous tomb\nThat weigh'd upon her gentle dust, a cloud\nMight gather o'er her beauty, and a gloom\nIn her dark eye, prophetic of the doom\nHeaven gives its favourites -- early death; yet shed\nA sunset charm around her, and illume\nWith hectic light, the Hesperus of the dead,\nOf her consuming cheek the autumnal leaf-like red.\n\nCIII\nPerchance she died in age -- surviving all,\nCharms, kindred, children -- with the silver gray\nOn her long tresses, which might yet recall,\nIt may be, still a something of the day\nWhen they were braided, and her proud array\nAnd lovely form were envied, praised, and eyed\nBy Rome -- But whither would Conjecture stray?\n\nThus much alone we know -- Metella died,\nThe wealthiest Roman's wife: Behold his love or pride!\nCIV\nI know not why -- but standing thus by thee\nIt seems as if I had thine inmate known,\nThou Tomb! and other days come back on me\nWith recollected music, though the tone\nIs changed and solemn, like the cloudy groan\nOf dying thunder on the distant wind;\nYet could I set me by this ivied stone\nTill I had bodied forth the heated mind,\nForms from the floating wreck which Ruin leaves behind;\nCV\nAnd from the planks, far shatter'd o'er the rocks,\nBuilt me a little bark of hope, once more\nTo battle with the ocean and the shocks\nOf the loud breakers, and the ceaseless roar\nWhich rushes on the solitary shore\nWhere all lies founder'd that was ever dear:\nBut could I gather from the wave-worn store\nEnough for my rude boat, where should I steer?\n\nThere woos no home, nor hope, nor life, save what is here.\n\nCVI\nThen let the winds howl on! their harmony\nShall henceforth be my music, and the night\nThe sound shall temper with the owlets' cry,\nAs I now hear them, in the fading light\nDim o'er the bird of darkness' native site,\nAnswering each other on the Palatine,\nWith their large eyes, all glistening gray and bright,\nAnd sailing pinions.\n\n-- Upon such a shrine\nWhat are our petty griefs?\n\n-- let me not number mine.\n\nCVII\nCypress and ivy, weed and wallflower grown,\nMatted and mass'd together, hillocks heap'd\nOn what were chambers, arch crush'd, column strown\nIn fragments, choked up vaults, and frescos steep'd\nIn subterranean damps, where the owl peep'd,\nDeeming it midnight: -- Temples, baths, or halls?\n\nPronounce who can; for all that Learning reap'd\nFrom her research hath been, that these are walls --\nBehold thee Imperial Mount! 'tis thus the mighty falls.\n\nCVIII\nThere is the moral of all human tales;\n'Tis but the same rehearsal of the past,\nFirst Freedom, and then Glory -- when that fails,\nWealth, vice , corruption, -- barbarism at last.\n\nAnd History, with all her volumes vast,\nHath but one page, -- 'tis better written here\nWhere gorgeous Tyranny hath thus amass'd\nAll treasures, all delights, that eye or ear,\nHeart, soul, could seek, tongue ask -- Away with words! draw near,\nCIX\nAdmire, exult, despise, laugh, weep, -- for here\nThere is such matter for all feeling: -- Man!\nThou pendulum betwixt a smile and tear,\nAges and realms are crowded in this span,\nThis mountain, whose obliterated plan\nThe pyramid of empires pinnacled,\nOf Glory's gewgaws shining in the van\nTill the sun's rays with added flame were fill'd!\nWhere are its golden roofs?\n\nwhere those who dared to build?\n\nCX\nTully was not so eloquent as thou,\nThou nameless column with the buried base!\nWhat are the laurels of the C\u00e6sar's brow?\n\nCrown me with ivy from his dwelling-place.\n\nWhose arch or pillar meets me in the face,\nTitus or Trajan's?\n\nNo -- 'tis that of Time:\nTriumph, arch, pillar, all he doth displace\nScoffing; and apostolic statues climb\nTo crush the imperial urn, whose ashes slept sublime,\nCXI\nBuried in air, the deep blue sky of Rome,\nAnd looking to the stars; they had contain'd\nA spirit which with thee would find a home,\nThe last of those who o'er the whole earth reign'd,\nThe Roman globe, for after none sustain'd,\nBut yielded back his conquests: -- he was more\nThan a mere Alexander, and unstain'd\nWith household blood and wine, serenely wore\nHis sovereign virtues -- still we Trajan's name adore.\n\nCXII\nWhere is the rock of Triumph, the high place\nWhere Rome embraced her heroes?\n\nwhere the steep\nTarpeian?\n\nfittest goal of Treason's race,\nThe promontory whence the Traitor's Leap\nCured all ambition.\n\nDid the conquerors heap\nTheir spoils here?\n\nYes; and in yon field below,\nA thousand years of silenced faction sleep --\nThe Forum, where the immortal accents glow,\nAnd still the eloquent air breathes -- burns with Cicero!\nCXIII\nThe field of freedom, faction, fame, and blood:\nHere a proud people's passions were exhaled,\nFrom the first hour of empire in the bud\nTo that when further worlds to conquer fail'd;\nBut long before had Freedom's face been veil'd,\nAnd Anarchy assumed her attributes;\nTill every lawless soldier who assail'd\nTrod on the trembling senate's slavish mutes,\nOr raised the venal voice of baser prostitutes.\n\nCXIV\nThen turn we to her latest tribune's name,\nFrom her ten thousand tyrants turn to thee,\nRedeemer of dark centuries of shame --\nThe friend of Petrarch -- hope of Italy --\nRienzi! last of Romans!

sweet creation of some heart\nWhich found no mortal resting-place so fair\nAs thine ideal breast; whate'er thou art\nOr wert, -- a young Aurora of the air,\nThe nympholepsy of some fond despair;\nOr, it might be, a beauty of the earth,\nWho found a more than common votary there\nToo much adoring; whatsoe'er thy birth,\nThou wert a beautiful thought, and softly bodied forth.\n\nCXVI\nThe mosses of thy fountain still are sprinkled\nWith thine Elysian water-drops; the face\nOf thy cave-guarded spring with years unwrinkled,\nReflects the meek-eyed genius of the place,\nWhose green, wild margin now no more erase\nArt's works; nor must the delicate waters sleep,\nPrison'd in marble -- bubbling from the base\nOf the cleft statue, with a gentle leap\nThe rill runs o'er -- and round -- fern, flowers, and ivy creep,\nCXVII\nFantastically tangled: the green hills\nAre clothed with early blossoms, through the grass\nThe quick-eyed lizard rustles, and the bills\nOf summer-birds sing welcome as ye pass;\nFlowers fresh in hue, and many in their class,\nImplore the pausing step, and with their dyes,\nDance in the soft breeze in a fairy mass;\nThe sweetness of the violet's deep blue eyes,\nKiss'd by the breath of heaven, seems colour'd by its skies.\n\nCXVIII\nHere didst thou dwell, in this enchanted cover,\nEgeria! thy all heavenly bosom beating\nFor the far footsteps of thy mortal lover;\nThe purple Midnight veil'd that mystic meeting\nWith her most starry canopy, and seating\nThyself by thine adorer, what befell?\n\nThis cave was surely shaped out for the greeting\nOf an enamour'd Goddess, and the cell\nHaunted by holy Love -- the earliest oracle!\nCXIX\nAnd didst thou not, thy breast to his replying,\nBlend a celestial with a human heart;\nAnd Love, which dies as it was born, in sighing,\nShare with immortal transports?\n\ncould thine art\nMake them indeed immortal, and impart\nThe purity of heaven to earthly joys,\nExpel the venom and not blunt the dart --\nThe dull satiety which all destroys --\nAnd root from out the soul the deadly weed which cloys?\n\nCXX\nAlas! our young affections run to waste,\nOr water but the desert; whence arise\nBut weeds of dark luxuriance, tares of haste,\nRank at the core, though tempting to the eyes,\nFlowers whose wild odours breathe but agonies,\nAnd trees whose gums are poisons; such the plants\nWhich spring beneath her steps as Passion flies\nO'er the world's wilderness, and vainly pants\nFor some celestial fruit forbidden to our wants.\n\nCXXI\nOh, Love! no habitant of earth thou art --\nAn unseen seraph, we believe in thee, --\nA faith whose martyrs are the broken heart, --\nBut never yet hath seen, nor e'er shall see\nThe naked eye, thy form, as it should be;\nThe mind hath made thee, as it peopled heaven,\nEven with its own desiring phantasy,\nAnd to a thought such shape and image given,\nAs haunts the unquench'd soul -- parch'd, wearied, wrung, and riven.\n\nCXXII\nOf its own beauty is the mind diseased,\nAnd fevers into false creation: -- where,\nWhere are the forms the sculptor's soul hath seiz'd?\n\nIn him alone.\n\nCan Nature show so fair?\n\nWhere are the charms and virtues which we dare\nConceive in boyhood and pursue as men,\nThe unreach'd Paradise of our despair,\nWhich o'er-informs the pencil and the pen,\nAnd overpowers the page where it would bloom again?\n\nCXXIII\nWho loves, raves -- 'tis youth's frenzy -- but the cure\nIs bitterer still, as charm by charm unwinds\nWhich robed our idols, and we see too sure\nNor worth nor beauty dwells from out the mind's\nIdeal shape of such; yet still it binds\nThe fatal spell, and still it draws us on,\nReaping the whirlwind from the oftsown winds;\nThe stubborn heart, its alchemy begun,\nSeems ever near the prize -- wealthiest when most undone.\n\nCXXIV\nWe wither from our youth, we gasp away --\nSick -- sick; unfound the boon, unslaked the thirst,\nThough to the last, in verge of our decay,\nSome phantom lures, such as we sought at first --\nBut all too late, -- so are we doubly curst.\n\nLove, fame, ambition, avarice -- 'tis the same,\nEach idle, and all ill, and none the worst --\nFor we all are meteors with a different name,\nAnd Death the sable smoke where vanishes the flame.\n\nCXXV\nFew -- none -- find what they love or could have loved,\nThough accident, blind contact, and the strong\nNecessity of loving, have removed\nAntipathies -- but to recur, ere long,\nEnvenom'd with irrevocable wrong;\nAnd Circumstance, that unspiritual god\nAnd miscreator, makes and helps along\nOur coming evils with a crutch-like rod,\nWhose touch turns Hope to dust, -- the dust we all have trod.\n\nCXXVI\nOur life is a false nature: 'tis not in\nThe harmony of things, -- this hard decree,\nThis uneradicable taint of sin\nThis boundless upas, this all-blasting tree,\nWhose root is earth, whose leaves and branches be\nThe skies which rain their plagues on men like dew --\nDisease, death, bondage -- all the woes we see,\nAnd worse, the woes we see not -- which throb through\nThe immedicable soul, with heart-aches ever new.\n\nCXXVII\nYet let us ponder boldly -- 'tis a base\nAbandonment of reason to resign\nOur right of thought -- our last and only place\nOf refuge; this, at least, shall still be mine:\nThough from our birth the faculty divine\nIs chain'd and tortured -- cabin'd, cribb'd, confined,\nAnd bred in darkness, lest the truth should shine\nToo brightly on the unprepar\u00e8d mind,\nThe beam pours in, for time and skill will couch the blind.\n\nCXXVIII\nArches on arches! as it were that Rome,\nCollecting the chief trophies of her line,\nWould build up all her triumphs in one dome,\nHer coliseum stands; the moonbeams shine\nAs 'twere its natural torches, for divine\nShould be the light which streams here to illume\nThis long-explored but still exhaustless mine\nOf contemplation; and the azure gloom\nOf an Italian night, where the deep skies assume\nCXXIX\nHues which have words, and speak to ye of heaven,\nFloats o'er this vast and wondrous monument,\nAnd shadows forth its glory.\n\nThere is given\nUnto the things of earth, which Time hath bent\nA spirit's feeling, and where he hath leant\nHis hand, but broke his scythe, there is a power\nAnd magic in the ruin'd battlement,\nFor which the palace of the present hour\nMust yield its pomp, and wait till ages are its dower.\n\nCXXX\nOh Time! the beautifier of the dead,\nAdorner of the ruin, comforter\nAnd only healer when the heart hath bled;\nTime! the corrector where our judgments err,\nThe test of truth, love, -- sole philosopher,\nFor all beside are sophists -- from thy thrift,\nWhich never loses though it doth defer --\nTime, the avenger! unto thee I lift\nMy hands, and eyes, and heart, and crave of thee a gift:\nCXXXI\nAmidst this wreck, where thou hast made a shrine\nAnd temple more divinely desolate,\nAmong thy mightier offerings here are mine,\nRuins of years, though few, yet full of fate:\nIf thou hast ever seen me too elate,\nHear me not; but if calmly I have borne\nGood, and reserved my pride against the hate\nWhich shall not whelm me, let me not have worn\nThis iron in my soul in vain -- shall they not mourn?\n\nCXXXII\nAnd thou, who never yet of human wrong\nLeft the unbalanced scale, great Nemesis!\nHere, where the ancient paid thee homage long --\nThou who didst call the Furies from the abyss,\nAnd round Orestes bade them howl and hiss\nFor that unnatural retribution -- just,\nHad it but been from hands less near -- in this\nThy former realm, I call thee from the dust!\nDost thou not hear my heart?\n\n-- Awake! thou shalt, and must.\n\nCXXXIII\nIt is not that I may not have incurr'd\nFor my ancestral faults or mine the wound\nI bleed withal, and, had it been conferr'd\nWith a just weapon, it had flow'd unbound;\nBut now my blood shall not sink in the ground;\nTo thee I do devote it.\n\n-- thou shalt take\nThe vengeance, which shall yet be sought and found,\nWhich if I have not taken for the sake --\nBut let that pass -- I sleep, but thou shalt yet awake.\n\nCXXXIV\nAnd if my voice break forth, 'tis not that now\nI shrink from what is suffer'd: let him speak\nWho hath beheld decline upon my brow,\nOr seen my mind's convulsion leave it weak;\nBut in this page a record will I seek.\n\nNot in the air shall these my words disperse,\nThough I be ashes; a far hour shall wreak\nThe deep prophetic fulness of this verse,\nAnd pile on human heads the mountain of my curse!\nCXXXV\nThat curse shall be Forgiveness.\n\n-- Have I not --\nHear me, my mother Earth! behold it, Heaven!\nHave I not had to wrestle with my lot?\n\nHave I not suffer'd things to be forgiven?\n\nHave I not had my brain sear'd, my heart riven,\nHopes sapp'd, name blighted, Life's life lied away?\n\nAnd only not to desperation driven,\nBecause not altogether of such clay\nAs rots into the souls of those whom I survey.\n\nCXXXVI\nFrom mighty wrongs to petty perfidy\nHave I not seen what human things could do?\n\nFrom the loud roar of foaming calumny\nTo the small whisper of the as paltry few,\nAnd subtler venom of the reptile crew,\nThe Janus glance of whose significant eye,\nLearning to lie with silence, would seem true,\nAnd without utterance, save the shrug or sign,\nDeal round to happy fools its speechless obloquy.\n\nCXXXVII\nBut I have lived, and have not lived in vain:\nMy mind may lose its force, my blood its fire,\nAnd my frame perish even in conquering pain;\nBut there is that within me which shall tire\nTorture and Time, and breathe when I expire;\nSomething unearthly, which they deem not of,\nLike the remember'd tone of a mute lyre,\nShall on their soften'd spirits sink, and move\nIn hearts all rocky now the late remorse of love.\n\nCXXXVIII\nThe seal is set.\n\n-- Now welcome, thou dread power!\nNameless, yet thus omnipotent, which here\nWalk'st in the shadow of the midnight hour\nWith a deep awe, yet all distinct from fear;\nThy haunts are ever where the dead walls rear\nTheir ivy mantles, and the solemn scene\nDerives from thee a sense so deep and clear\nThat we become a part of what has been,\nAnd grow unto the spot, all-seeing but unseen.\n\nCXXXIX\nAnd here the buzz of eager nations ran,\nIn murmur'd pity, or loud-roar'd applause,\nAs man was slaughter'd by his fellow-man.\n\nAnd wherefore slaughter'd?\n\nwherefore, but because\nSuch were the bloody Circus' genial laws,\nAnd the imperial pleasure.\n\n-- Wherefore not?\n\nWhat matters where we fall to fill the maws\nOf worms -- on battle-plains or listed spot?\n\nBoth are but theatres -- where the chief actors rot.\n\nCXL\nI see before me the Gladiator lie:\nHe leans upon his hand -- his manly brow\nConsents to death, but conquers agony,\nAnd his droop'd head sinks gradually low --\nAnd through his side the last drops, ebbing slow\nFrom the red gash, fall heavy, one by one,\nLike the first of a thunder-shower; and now\nThe arena swims around him -- he is gone,\nEre ceased the inhuman shout which hail'd the wretch who won.\n\nCXLI\nHe heard it, but he heeded not -- his eyes\nWere with his heart, and that was far away;\nHe reck'd not of the life he lost nor prize,\nBut where his rude hut by the Danube lay,\nThere where his young barbarians all at play,\nThere was their Dacian mother -- he, their sire,\nButcher'd to make a Roman holiday --\nAll this rush'd with his blood -- Shall he expire\nAnd unavenged?\n\nArise! ye Goths, and glut your ire!\nCXLII\nBut here, where Murder breathed her bloody steam;\nAnd here, where buzzing nations choked the ways,\nAnd roar'd or murmur'd like a mountain stream\nDashing or winding as its torrent strays;\nHere, where the Roman million's blame or praise\nWas death or life, the playthings of a crowd,\nMy voice sounds much -- and fall the stars faint rays\nOn the arena void -- seats crush'd -- walls bow'd --\nAnd galleries, where my steps seem echoes strangely loud.\n\nCXLIII\nA ruin -- yet what a ruin! from its mass\nWalls, palaces, half-cities, have been rear'd;\nYet oft the enormous skeleton ye pass,\nAnd marvel where the spoil could have appear'd.\n\nHath it indeed been plunder'd, or but clear'd?\n\nAlas! developed, opens the decay,\nWhen the colossal fabric's form is near'd:\nIt will not bear the brightness of the day,\nWhich streams too much on all -- years -- man -- have reft away.\n\nCXLIV\nBut when the rising moon begins to climb\nIts topmost arch, and gently pauses there;\nWhen the stars twinkle through the loops of time,\nAnd the low night-breeze waves along the air\nThe garland-forest, which the gray walls wear,\nLike laurels on the bald first C\u00e6sar's head;\nWhen the light shines serene but doth not glare,\nThen in this magic circle raise the dead:\nHeroes have trod this spot -- 'tis on their dust ye tread.\n\nCXLV\n'While stands the Coliseum, Rome shall stand;\n'When falls the Coliseum, Rome shall fall;\n'And when Rome falls -- the World.\n\n' From our own land\nThus spake the pilgrims o'er this mighty wall\nIn Saxon times, which we are wont to call\nAncient; and these three mortal things are still\nOn their foundations, and unalter'd all;\nRome and her Ruin past Redemption's skill,\nThe World, the same wide den -- of thieves, or what ye will.\n\nCXLVI\nSimple, erect, severe, austere, sublime --\nShrine of all saints and temple of all gods,\nFrom Jove to Jesus -- spared and blest by time;\nLooking tranquillity, while falls or nods\nArch, empire, each thing round thee, and man plods\nHis way through thorns to ashes -- glorious dome!\nShalt thou not last?\n\nTime's scythe and tyrants' rods\nShiver upon thee -- sanctuary and home\nOf art and piety -- Pantheon! -- pride of Rome!\nCXLVII\nRelic of nobler days, and noblest arts!\nDespoil'd yet perfect, with thy circle spreads\nA holiness appealing to all hearts --\nTo art a model; and to him who treads\nRome for the sake of ages, Glory sheds\nHer light through thy sole aperture; to those\nWho worship, here are altars for their beads;\nAnd they who feel for genius may repose\nTheir eyes on honour'd forms, whose busts around them close.\n\nCXLVIII\nThere is a dungeon, in whose dim drear light\nWhat do I gaze on?\n\nNothing: Look again!\nTwo forms are slowly shadow'd on my sight --\nTwo insulated phantoms of the brain:\nIt is not so; I see them full and plain --\nAn old man, and a female young and fair,\nFresh as a nursing mother, in whose vein\nThe blood is nectar: -- but what doth she there,\nWith her unmantled neck, and bosom white and bare?\n\nCXLIX\nFull swells the deep pure fountain of young life,\nWhere on the heart and from the heart we took\nOur first and sweetest nurture, when the wife,\nBlest into mother, in the innocent look,\nOr even the piping cry of lips that brook\nNo pain and small suspense, a joy perceives\nMan knows not, when from out its cradled nook\nShe sees her little bud put forth its leaves --\nWhat may the fruit be yet?\n\nI know not -- Cain was Eve's.\n\nCL\nBut here youth offers to old age the food,\nThe milk of his own gift: it is her sire\nTo whom she renders back the debt of blood\nBorn with her birth.\n\nNo; he shall not expire\nWhile in those warm and lovely veins the fire\nOf health and holy feeling can provide\nGreat Nature's Nile, whose deep stream rises higher\nThan Egypt's river: from that gentle side\nDrink, drink and live, old man! Heaven's realm holds no such tide.\n\nCLI\nThe starry fable of the milky way\nHas not thy story's purity; it is\nA constellation of a sweeter ray,\nAnd sacred Nature triumphs more in this\nReverse of her decree, than in the abyss\nWhere sparkle distant worlds: -- Oh, holiest nurse!\nNo drop of that clear stream its way shall miss\nTo thy sire's heart, replenishing its source\nWith life, as our freed souls rejoin the universe.\n\nCLII\nTurn to the mole which Hadrian rear'd on high,\nImperial mimic of old Egypt's piles,\nColossal copyist of deformity\nWhose travell'd phantasy from the far Nile's\nEnormous model, doom'd the artist's toils\nTo build for giants, and for his vain earth,\nHis shrunken ashes, raise this dome: How smiles\nThe gazer's eyes with philosophic mirth,\nTo view the huge design which sprung from such a birth!\nCLIII\nBut lo! the dome -- the vast and wondrous dome,\nTo which Diana's marvel was a cell --\nChrist's mighty shrine above his martyr's tomb!\nI have beheld the Ephesian's miracle; --\nIts columns strew the wilderness, and dwell\nThe hy\u00e6na and the jackal in their shade;\nI have beheld Sophia's bright roofs swell\nTheir glittering mass i' the sun, and have survey'd\nIts sanctuary the while the usurping Moslem pray'd;\nCLIV\nBut thou, of temples old, or altars new,\nStandest alone, with nothing like to thee --\nWorthiest of God, the holy and the true.\n\nSince Zion's desolation, when that He\nForsook his former city, what could be,\nOf earthly structures, in his honour piled,\nOf a sublimer aspect?\n\nMajesty,\nPower, Glory, Strength, and Beauty all are aisled\nIn this eternal ark of worship undefiled.\n\nCLV\nEnter: its grandeur overwhelms thee not;\nAnd why?\n\nIt is not lessen'd; but thy mind,\nExpanded by the genius of the spot,\nHas grown colossal, and can only find\nA fit abode wherein appear enshrined\nThy hopes of immortality; and thou\nShalt one day, if found worthy, so defined,\nSee thy God face to face, as thou dost now\nHis Holy of Holies, nor be blasted by his brow.\n\nCLVI\nThou movest, but increasing with the advance,\nLike climbing some great Alp, which still doth rise,\nDeceived by its gigantic elegance;\nVastness which grows, but grows to harmonise --\nAll musical in its immensities;\nRich marbles, richer painting -- shrines where flame\nThe lamps of gold -- and haughty dome which view\nIn air with Earth's chief structures, though their frame\nSits on the firm-set ground, and this the clouds must claim.\n\nCLVII\nThou seest not all; but piecemeal thou must break,\nTo separate contemplation, the great whole;\nAnd as the ocean many bays will make\nThat ask the eye -- so here condense thy soul\nTo more immediate objects, and control\nThy thoughts until thy mind hath got by heart\nIts eloquent proportions, and unroll\nIn mighty graduations, part by part,\nThe glory which at once upon thee did not dart,\nCLVIII\nNot by its fault -- but thine: Our outward sense\nIs but of gradual grasp -- and as it is\nThat what we have of feeling most intense\nOutstrips our faint expression; even so this\nOutshining and o'erwhelming edifice\nFools our fond gaze,and greatest of the great\nDefies at first our Nature's littleness,\nTill growing with its growth, we thus dilate\nOur spirits to the size of that they contemplate.\n\nCLVIX\nThen pause, and be enlighten'd; there is more\nIn such a survey than the sating gaze\nOf wonder pleased, or awe which would adore\nThe worship of the place, or the mere praise\nOf art and its great masters, who could raise\nWhat former time, nor skill, nor thought could plan;\nThe fountain of sublimity displays\nIts depth, and thence may draw the mind of man\nIts golden sands, and learn what great conceptions can.\n\nCLX\nOr, turning to the Vatican, go see\nLaoco\u00f6n's torture dignifying pain --\nA father's love and mortal's agony\nWith an immortal's patience blending: -- Vain\nThe struggle vain, against the coiling strain\nAnd gripe, and deepening of the dragon's grasp,\nThe old man's clench; the long unvenom'd chain\nRivets the living links, -- the enormous asp\nEnforces pang on pang, and stifles gasp on gasp.\n\nCLXI\nOr view the Lord of the unerring bow,\nThe God of life, and poesy, and light --\nThe Sun in human limbs array'd, and brow\nAll radiant from his triumph in the fight;\nThe shaft hath just been shot -- the arrow bright\nWith an immortal's vengeance; in his eye\nAnd nostril beautiful disdain, and might\nAnd majesty, flash their full lightnings by,\nDeveloping in that once glance the Deity.\n\nCLXII\nBut in his delicate form -- a dream of Love,\nShaped by some solitary nymph, whose breast\nLong'd for a deathless lover from above,\nAnd madden'd in that vision -- are exprest\nAll that ideal beauty ever bless'd\nThe mind with in its most unearthly mood,\nWhen each conception was a heavenly guest --\nA ray of immortality -- and stood\nStarlike, around, until they gather'd to a god!\nCLXIII\nAnd if it be Prometheus stole from Heaven\nThe fire which we endure, it was repaid\nBy him to whom the energy was given\nWhich this poetic marble hath array'd\nWith an eternal glory -- which, if made\nBy human hands, is not of human thought;\nAnd Time himself hath hallow'd it, nor laid\nOne ringlet in the dust -- nor hath it caught\nA tinge of years, but breathes the flame with which 'twas wrought.\n\nCLXIV\nBut where is he, the Pilgrim of my song,\nThe being who upheld it through the past?\n\nMethinks he cometh late and tarries long.\n\nHe is no more -- these breathings are his last;\nHis wanderings done, his visions ebbing fast,\nAnd he himself as nothing: -- if he was\nAught but a phantasy, and could be class'd\nWith forms which live and suffer -- let that pass --\nHis shadow fades away into Destruction's mass,\nCLXV\nWhich gathers shadow, substance, life, and all\nThat we inherit in its mortal shroud,\nAnd spreads the dim and universal pall\nThrough which all things grow phantoms; and the cloud\nBetween us sinks and all which ever glow'd,\nTill Glory's self is twilight, and displays\nA melancholy halo scarce allow'd\nTo hover on the verge of darkness; rays\nSadder than saddest night, for they distract the gaze,\nCLXVI\nAnd send us prying into the abyss,\nTo gather what we shall be when the frame\nShall be resolved to something less than this\nIts wretched essence; and to dream of fame,\nAnd wipe the dust from off the idle name\nWe never more shall hear, -- but never more\nOh, happier thought! can we be made the same:\nIt is enough in sooth that once we bore\nThese fardels of the heart -- the heart whose sweat was gore.\n\nCLXVII\nHark! forth from the abyss a voice proceeds,\nA long low distant murmur of dread sound,\nSuch as arises when a nation bleeds\nWith some deep and immedicable wound;\nThrough storm and darkness yawns the rending ground,\nThe gulf is thick with phantoms, but the chief\nSeems royal still, though with her head discrown'd,\nAnd pale, but lovely, with maternal grief\nShe clasps a babe, to whom her breast yields no relief.\n\nCLXVIII\nScion of chiefs and monarchs, where art thou?\n\nFond hope of many nations, art thou dead?\n\nCould not the grave forget thee, and lay low\nSome less majestic, less beloved head?\n\nIn the sad midnight, while thy heart still bled,\nThe mother of a moment, o'er thy boy,\nDeath hush'd that pang for ever: with thee fled\nThe present happiness and promised joy\nWhich fill'd the imperial isles so full it seem'd to cloy.\n\nCLXIX\nPeasants bring forth in safety.\n\n-- Can it be,\nOh thou that wert so happy, so adored!\nThose who weep not for kings shall weep for thee,\nAnd Freedom's heart, grown heavy, cease to hoard\nHer many griefs for ONE; for she had pour'd\nHer orisons for thee, and o'er thy head\nBeheld her Iris.\n\n-- Thou, too, lonely lord,\nAnd desolate consort -- vainly wert thou wed!\nThe husband of a year! the father of the dead!\nCLXX\nOf sackcloth was thy wedding garment made;\nThy bridal's fruit is ashes: in the dust\nThe fair-hair'd Daughter of the Isles is laid,\nThe love of millions!

navell'd in the woody hills\nSo far, that the uprooting wind which tears\nThe oak from his foundation, and which spills\nThe ocean o'er its boundary, and bears\nIts foam against the skies, reluctant spares\nThe oval mirror of thy glassy lake;\nAnd calm as cherish'd hate, its surface wears\nA deep cold settled aspect nought can shake,\nAll coil'd into itself and round, as sleeps the snake.\n\nCLXXIV\nAnd near, Albano's scarce divided waves\nShine from a sister valley; -- and afar\nThe Tiber winds, and the broad ocean laves\nThe Latian coast where sprung the Epic war,\n'Arms and the Man,' whose re-ascending star\nRose o'er an empire: -- but beneath thy right\nTully reposed from Rome; -- and where yon bar\nOf girdling mountains intercepts the sight\nThe Sabine farm was till'd, the weary bard's delight.\n\nCLXXV\nBut I forget.\n\n-- My Pilgrim's shrine is won,\nAnd he and I must part, -- so let it be, --\nHis task and mine alike are nearly done;\nYet once more let us look upon the sea;\nThe midland ocean breaks on him and me,\nAnd from the Alban Mount we now behold\nOur friend of youth, that Ocean, which when we\nBeheld it last by Calpe's rock unfold\nThose waves, we follow'd on till the dark Euxine roll'd\nCLXXVI\nUpon the blue Symplegades: long years --\nLong, though not very many -- since have done\nTheir work on both; some suffering and some tears\nHave left us nearly where we had begun:\nYet not in vain our mortal race hath run;\nWe have had our reward, and it is here, --\nThat we can yet feel gladden'd by the sun,\nAnd reap from earth, sea, joy almost as dear\nAs if there were no man to trouble what is clear.\n\nCLXXVII\nOh!

but then 'tis in the head;\nYet as the consequences are as bright\nAs if they acted with the heart instead,\nWhat after all can signify the site\nOf ladies' lucubrations?\n\nSo they lead\nIn safety to the place for which you start,\nWhat matters if the road be head or heart?\n\nXXXV\nJuan presented in the proper place,\nTo proper placement, every Russ credential;\nAnd was receiv'd with all the due grimace\nBy those who govern in the mood potential,\nWho, seeing a handsome stripling with smooth face,\nThought (what in state affairs is most essential)\nThat they as easily mightdothe youngster,\nAs hawks may pounce upon a woodland songster.\n\nXXXVI\nThey err'd, as aged men will do; but by\nAnd by we'll talk of that; and if we don't,\n'T will be because our notion is not high\nOf politicians and their double front,\nWho live by lies, yet dare not boldly lie:\nNow, what I love in women is, they won't\nOr can't do otherwise than lie, but do it\nSo well, the very truth seems falsehood to it.\n\nXXXVII\nAnd, after all, what is a lie?\n\n'Tis but\nThe truth in masquerade; and I defy\nHistorians, heroes, lawyers, priests, to put\nA fact without some leaven of a lie.\n\nThe very shadow of true Truth would shut\nUp annals, revelations, poesy,\nAnd prophecy\u2014except it should be dated\nSome years before the incidents related.\n\nXXXVIII\nPrais'd be all liars and all lies! Who now\nCan tax my mild Muse with misanthropy?\n\nShe rings the World's \"Te Deum,\" and her brow\nBlushes for those who will not: but to sigh\nIs idle; let us like most others bow,\nKiss hands, feet, any part of Majesty,\nAfter the good example of \"Green Erin,\"\nWhose shamrock now seems rather worse for wearing.\n\nXXXIX\nDon Juan was presented, and his dress\nAnd mien excited general admiration;\nI don't know which was more admir'd or less:\nOne monstrous diamond drew much observation,\nWhich Catherine in a moment of \"ivresse\"\n(In love or brandy's fervent fermentation)\nBestow'd upon him, as the public learn'd;\nAnd, to say truth, it had been fairly earn'd.\n\nXL\nBesides the ministers and underlings,\nWho must be courteous to the accredited\nDiplomatists of rather wavering kings,\nUntil their royal riddle's fully read,\nThe very clerks\u2014those somewhat dirty springs\nOf Office, or the House of Office, fed\nBy foul corruption into streams\u2014even they\nWere hardly rude enough to earn their pay.\n\nXLI\nAnd insolence no doubt is what they are\nEmploy'd for, since it is their daily labour,\nIn the dear offices of peace or war;\nAnd should you doubt, pray ask of your next neighbour,\nWhen for a passport, or some other bar\nTo freedom, he applied (a grief and a bore),\nIf he found not this spawn of tax-born riches,\nLike lap-dogs, the least civil sons of b{-}{-}{-}{-}{-}s.\n\nXLII\nBut Juan was receiv'd with much \"empressement\" \u2014\nThese phrases of refinement I must borrow\nFrom our next neighbours' land, where, like a chessman,\nThere is a move set down for joy or sorrow,\nNot only in mere talking, but the press.\n\nMan\nIn islands is, it seems, downright and thorough,\nMore than on continents\u2014as if the sea\n(See Billingsgate) made even the tongue more free.\n\nXLIII\nAnd yet the British \"Damme\" 's rather Attic,\nYour continental oaths are but incontinent,\nAnd turn on things which no aristocratic\nSpirit would name, and therefore even I won't anent\nThis subject quote; as it would be schismatic\nIn politesse, and have a sound affronting in 't;\nBut \"Damme\" 's quite ethereal, though too daring\u2014\nPlatonic blasphemy, the soul of swearing.\n\nXLIV\nFor downright rudeness, ye may stay at home;\nFor true or false politeness (and scarcethat\nNow) you may cross the blue deep and white foam:\nThe first the emblem (rarely though) of what\nYou leave behind, the next of much you come\nTo meet.\n\nHowever, 'tis no time to chat\nOn general topics: poems must confine\nThemselves to Unity, like this of mine.\n\nXLV\nIn the great world\u2014which, being interpreted,\nMeaneth the West or worst end of a city,\nAnd about twice two thousand people bred\nBy no means to be very wise or witty,\nBut to sit up while others lie in bed,\nAnd look down on the Universe with pity\u2014\nJuan, as an inveterate patrician,\nWas well receiv'd by persons of condition.\n\nXLVI\nHe was a bachelor, which is a matter\nOf import both to virgin and to bride,\nThe former's hymeneal hopes to flatter;\nAnd (should she not hold fast by love or pride)\n'Tis also of some momemt to the latter:\nA rib's a thorn in a wed gallant's side,\nRequires decorum, and is apt to double\nThe horrid sin\u2014and what's still worse the trouble.\n\nXLVII\nBut Juan was a bachelor\u2014of arts,\nAnd parts, and hearts: he danc'd and sung, and had\nAn air as sentimental as Mozart's\nSoftest of melodies; and could be sad\nOr cheerful, without any \"flaws or starts,\"\nJust at the proper time; and though a lad,\nHad seen the world\u2014which is a curious sight,\nAnd very much unlike what people write.\n\nXLVIII\nFair virgins blush'd upon him; wedded dames\nBloom'd also in less transitory hues;\nFor both commodities dwell by the Thames\nThe painting and the painted; Youth, Ceruse,\nAgainst his heart preferr'd their usual claims,\nSuch as no gentleman can quite refuse;\nDaughters admir'd his dress, and pious mothers\nInquir'd his income, and if he had brothers.\n\nXLIX\nThe milliners who furnish \"drapery Misses\"\nThroughout the season, upon speculation\nOf payment ere the Honeymoon's last kisses\nHave wan'd into a crescent's coruscation,\nThought such an opportunity as this is,\nOf a rich foreigner's initiation,\nNot to be overlook'd\u2014and gave such credit,\nThat future bridegrooms swore, and sigh'd, and paid it.\n\nL\nThe Blues, that tender tribe, who sigh o'er sonnets,\nAnd with the pages of the last Review\nLine the interior of their heads or bonnets,\nAdvanc'd in all their azure's highest hue:\nThey talk'd bad French or Spanish, and upon its\nLate authors ask'd him for a hint or two;\nAnd which was softest, Russian or Castilian?\n\nAnd whether in his travels he saw Ilion?\n\nLI\nJuan, who was a little superficial,\nAnd not in literature a great Drawcansir,\nExamin'd by this learned and especial\nJury of matrons, scarce knew what to answer:\nHis duties warlike, loving or official,\nHis steady application as a dancer,\nHad kept him from the brink of Hippocrene,\nWhich now he found was blue instead of green.\n\nLII\nHowever, he replied at hazard, with\nA modest confidence and calm assurance,\nWhich lent his learned lucubrations pith,\nAnd pass'd for arguments of good endurance.\n\nThat prodigy, Miss Araminta Smith\n(Who at sixteen translated \"Hercules Furens\"\nInto as furious English), with her best look,\nSet down his sayings in her common-place book.\n\nLIII\nJuan knew several languages\u2014as well\nHe might\u2014and brought them up with skill, in time\nTo save his fame with each accomplish'd belle,\nWho still regretted that he did not rhyme.\n\nThere wanted but this requisite to swell\nHis qualities (with them) into sublime:\nLady Fitz-Frisky, and Miss M{ae}via Mannish,\nBoth long'd extremely to be sung in Spanish.\n\nLIV\nHowever, he did pretty well, and was\nAdmitted as an aspirant to all\nThe coteries, and, as in Banquo's glass,\nAt great assemblies or in parties small,\nHe saw ten thousand living authors pass,\nThat being about their average numeral;\nAlso the eighty \"greatest living poets,\"\nAs every paltry magazine can showit's.\n\nLV\nIn twice five years the \"greatest living poet,\"\nLike to the champion in the fisty ring,\nIs call'd on to support his claim, or show it,\nAlthough 'tis an imaginary thing,\nEven I\u2014albeit I'm sure I did not know it,\nNor sought of foolscap subjects to be king\u2014\nWas reckon'd, a considerable time,\nThe grand Napoleon of the realms of rhyme.\n\nLVI\nBut Juan was my Moscow, and Faliero\nMy Leipsic, and my Mont Saint Jean seem Cain:\n\"La Belle Alliance\" of dunces down at zero,\nNow that the Lion's fall'n, may rise again,\nBut I will fall at least as fell my hero;\nNor reign at all, or as amonarchreign;\nOr to some lonely isle of jailors go,\nWith turncoat Southey for my turnkey Lowe.\n\nLVII\nSir Walter reign'd before me;

I am,\nGod knows, as helpless as the devil can wish,\nAnd not a whit more difficult to damn,\nThan is to bring to land a late-hook'd fish,\nOr to the butcher to purvey the lamb;\nNot that I'm fit for such a noble dish,\nAs one day will be that immortal fry\nOf almost everybody born to die.\n\nXVI.\n\nSaint Peter sat by the celestial gate,\nAnd nodded o'er his keys; when, lo! there came\nA wondrous noise he had not heard of late \u2014\nA rushing sound of wind, and stream, and flame;\nIn short, a roar of things extremely great,\nWhich would have made aught save a saint exclaim;\nBut he, with first a start and then a wink,\nSaid, 'There's another star gone out, I think!'\nXVII.\n\nBut ere he could return to his repose,\nA cherub flapp'd his right wing o'er his eyes \u2014\nAt which St.\n\nPeter yawn'd, and rubb'd his hose:\n'Saint porter,' said the angel, 'prithee rise!'\nWaving a goodly wing, which glow'd, as glows\nAn earthly peacock's tail, with heavenly dyes;\nTo which the saint replied, 'Well, what's the matter?\n\n'Is Lucifer come back with all this clatter?\n\nXVIII.\n\n'No,' quoth the cherub; 'George the Third is dead.\n\n'And who is George the Third?\n\n' replied the apostle;\n'What George?\n\nwhat Third?\n\n' 'The king of England,' said\nThe angel.\n\n'Well, he won't find kings to jostle\nHim on his way; but does he wear his head?\n\nBecause the last we saw here had a tussle,\nAnd ne'er would have got into heaven's good graces,\nHad he not flung his head in all our faces.\n\nXIX.\n\n'He was, if I remember, king of France;\nThat head of his, which could not keep a crown\nOn earth, yet ventured in my face to advance\nA claim to those of martyrs \u2014 like my own:\nIf I had had my sword, as I had once\nWhen I cut ears off, I had cut him down;\nBut having but my keys, and not my brand,\nI only knock'd his head from out his hand.\n\nXX.\n\n'And then he set up such a headless howl,\nThat all the saints came out and took him in;\nAnd there he sits by St.\n\nPaul, cheek by jowl;\nThat fellow Paul--the parven\u00f9! The skin\nOf St.\n\nBartholomew, which makes his cowl\nIn heaven, and upon earth redeem'd his sin,\nSo as to make a martyr, never sped\nBetter than did this weak and wooden head.\n\nXXI.\n\n'But had it come up here upon its shoulders,\nThere would have been a different tale to tell;\nThe fellow-feeling in the saint's beholders\nSeems to have acted on them like a spell,\nAnd so this very foolish head heaven solders\nBack on its trunk: it may be very well,\nAnd seems the custom here to overthrow\nWhatever has been wisely done below.\n\nXXII.\n\nThe angel answer'd, 'Peter! do not pout:\nThe king who comes has head and all entire,\nAnd never knew much what it was about--\nHe did as doth the puppet--by its wire,\nAnd will be judged like all the rest, no doubt:\nMy business and your own is not to inquire\nInto such matters, but to mind our cue--\nWhich is to act as we are bid to do.\n\nXXIII.\n\nWhile thus they spake, the angelic caravan,\nArriving like a rush of mighty wind,\nCleaving the fields of space, as doth the swan\nSome silver stream (say Ganges, Nile, or Inde,\nOr Thames, or Tweed), and 'midst them an old man\nWith an old soul, and both extremely blind,\nHalted before the gate, and in his shroud\nSeated their fellow traveller on a cloud.\n\nXXIV.\n\nBut bringing up the rear of this bright host\nA Spirit of a different aspect waves\nHis wings, like thunder-clou ds above some coast\nWhose barren beach with frequent wrecks is paved;\nHis brow was like the deep when tempest-toss 'd;\nFierce and unfathomable\u00a0 thoughts engraved\nEternal wrath on his immortal face,\nAnd where he gazed a gloom pervaded space.\n\nXXV.\n\nAs he drew near, he gazed upon the gate\nNe'er to be enter'd more by him or Sin,\nWith such a glance of supernatural\u00a0 hate,\nAs made Saint Peter wish himself within;\nHe potter'd with his keys at a great rate,\nAnd sweated through his apostolic skin:\nOf course his perspiration\u00a0 was but ichor,\nOr some such other spiritual liquor.\n\nXXIV.\n\nThe very cherubs huddled all together,\nLike birds when soars the falcon; and they felt\nA tingling to the top of every feather,\nAnd form'd a circle like Orion's belt\nAround their poor old charge; who scarce knew whither\nHis guards had led him, though they gently dealt\nWith royal manes (for by many stories,\nAnd true, we learn the angels all are Tories.\n\nXXVII.\n\nAs things were in this posture, the gate flew\nAsunder, and the flashing of its hinges\nFlung over space an universal hue\nOf many-colour' d flame, until its tinges\nReach'd even our speck of earth, and made a new\nAurora borealis spread its fringes\nO'er the North Pole; the same seen, when ice-bound,\nBy Captain Parry's crew, in 'Melville's Sound.\n\nXXVIII.\n\nAnd from the gate thrown open issued beaming\nA beautiful and mighty Thing of Light,\nRadiant with glory, like a banner streaming\nVictorious from some world-o'erth rowing fight:\nMy poor comparisons must needs be teeming\nWith earthly likenesses, for here the night\nOf clay obscures our best conceptions,\u00a0 saving\nJohanna Southcote, or Bob Southey raving.\n\nXXIX.\n\n'Twas the archangel Michael; all men know\nThe make of angels and archangels, since\nThere's scarce a scribbler has not one to show,\nFrom the fiends' leader to the angels' prince;\nThere also are some altar-pieces , though\nI really can't say that they much evince\nOne's inner notions of immortal spirits;\nBut let the connoisseurs\u00a0 explain their merits.\n\nXXX.\n\nMichael flew forth in glory and in good;\nA goodly work of him from whom all glory\nAnd good arise; the portal past \u2014 he stood;\nBefore him the young cherubs and saints hoary \u2014\n(I say young, begging to be understood\nBy looks, not years; and should be very sorry\nTo state, they were not older than St.\n\nPeter,\nBut merely that they seem'd a little sweeter.\n\nXXXI.\n\nThe cherubs and the saints bow'd down before\nThat arch-angelic\u00a0 Hierarch, the first\nOf essences angelical, who wore\nThe aspect of a god; but this ne'er nursed\nPride in his heavenly bosom, in whose core\nNo thought, save for his Master's service, durst\nIntrude, however glorified and high;\nHe knew him but the viceroy of the sky.\n\nXXXII.\n\nHe and the sombre, silent Spirit met \u2014\nThey knew each other both for good and ill;\nSuch was their power, that neither could forget\nHis former friend and future foe; but still\nThere was a high, immortal, proud regret\nIn either's eye, as if 'twere less their will\nThan destiny to make the eternal years\nTheir date of war, and their 'champ clos' the spheres.\n\nXXXIII.\n\nBut here they were in neutral space: we know\nFrom Job, that Satan hath the power to pay\nA heavenly visit thrice a year or so;\nAnd that the 'sons of God', like those of clay,\nMust keep him company; and we might show\nFrom the same book, in how polite a way\nThe dialogue is held between the Powers\nOf Good and Evil \u2014 but 'twould take up hours.\n\nXXXIV.\n\nAnd this is not a theologic tract,\nTo prove with Hebrew and with Arabic,\nIf Job be allegory or a fact,\nBut a true narrative; and thus I pick\nFrom out the whole but such and such an act\nAs sets aside the slightest thought of trick.\n\n'Tis every tittle true, beyond suspicion,\nAnd accurate as any other vision.\n\nXXXV.\n\nThe spirits were in neutral space, before\nThe gates of heaven; like eastern thresholds is\nThe place where Death's grand cause is argued o'er,\nAnd souls despatch'd to that world or to this;\nAnd therefore Michael and the other wore\nA civil aspect: though they did not kiss,\nYet still between his Darkness and his Brightness\nThere pass'd a mutual glance of great politeness.\n\nXXXVI.\n\nThe Archangel bow'd, not like a modern beau,\nBut with a graceful Oriental bend,\nPressing one radiant arm just where below\nThe heart in good men is supposed to tend;\nHe turn'd as to an equal, not too low,\nBut kindly; Satan met his ancient friend\nWith more hauteur, as might an old Castilian\nPoor noble meet a mushroom rich civilian.\n\nXXXVII.\n\nHe merely bent his diabolic brow\nAn instant; and then raising it, he stood\nIn act to assert his right or wrong, and show\nCause why King George by no means could or should\nMake out a case to be exempt from woe\nEternal, more than other kings, endued\nWith better sense and hearts, whom history mentions,\nWho long have 'paved hell with their good intentions.\n\nXXXVIII.\n\nMichael began: 'What wouldst thou with this man,\nNow dead, and brought before the Lord?\n\nWhat ill\nHath he wrought since his mortal race began,\nThat thou cans't claim him?\n\nSpeak! and do thy will,\nIf it be just: if in this earthly span\nHe hath been greatly failing to fulfil\nHis duties as a king and mortal, say,\nAnd he is thine; if not, let him have way.\n\nXXXIX.\n\n'Michael!' replied the Prince of Air, 'even here,\nBefore the Gate of him thou servest, must\nI claim my subject: and will make appear\nThat as he was my worshipper in dust,\nSo shall he be in spirit, although dear\nTo thee and thine, because nor wine nor lust\nWere of his weaknesses; yet on the throne\nHe reign'd o'er millions to serve me alone.\n\nXL.\n\n'Look to our earth, or rather mine; it was,\nOnce, more thy master's: but I triumph not\nIn this poor planet's conquest; nor, alas!\nNeed he thou servest envy me my lot:\nWith all the myriads of bright worlds which pass\nIn worship round him, he may have forgot\nYon weak creation of such paltry things;\nI think few worth damnation save their kings,--\nXLI.\n\n'And these but as a kind of quit-rent, to\nAssert my right as lord: and even had\nI such an inclination,\u00a0 'twere (as you\nWell know) superfluous;\u00a0 they are grown so bad,\nThat hell has nothing better left to do\nThan leave them to themselves: so much more mad\nAnd evil by their own internal curse,\nHeaven cannot make them better, nor I worse.\n\nXLII.\n\n'Look to the earth, I said, and say again:\nWhen this old, blind, mad, helpless, weak, poor worm\nBegan in youth's first bloom and flush to reign,\nThe world and he both wore a different form,\nAnd must of earth and all the watery plain\nOf ocean call'd him king: through many a storm\nHis isles had floated on the abyss of time;\nFor the rough virtues chose them for their clime.\n\nXLIII.\n\n'He came to his sceptre young: he leaves it old:\nLook to the state in which he found his realm,\nAnd left it; and his annals too behold,\nHow to a minion first he gave the helm;\nHow grew upon his heart a thirst for gold,\nThe beggar's vice, which can but overwhelm\nThe meanest of hearts; and for the rest, but glance\nThine eye along America and France.\n\nXLIV.\n\n'Tis true, he was a tool from first to last\n(I have the workmen safe); but as a tool\nSo let him be consumed.\n\nFrom out the past\nOf ages, since mankind have known the rule\nOf monarchs \u2014 from the bloody rolls amass'd\nOf sin and slaughter \u2014 from the C\u00e6sar's school,\nTake the worst pupil; and produce a reign\nMore drench'd with gore, more cumber'd with the slain.\n\nXLV.\n\n'He ever warr'd with freedom and the free:\nNations as men, home subjects, foreign foes,\nSo that they utter'd the word \"Liberty!\"\nFound George the Third their first opponent.\n\nWhose\nHistory was ever stain'd as his will be\nWith national and individual woes?\n\nI grant his household abstinence; I grant\nHis neutral virtues, which most monarchs want;\nXLVI.\n\n'I know he was a constant consort; own\nHe was a decent sire, and middling lord.\n\nAll this is much, and most upon a throne;\nAs temperance, if at Apicius' board,\nIs more than at an anchorite's supper shown.\n\nI grant him all the kindest can accord;\nAnd this was well for him, but not for those\nMillions who found him what oppression chose.\n\nXLVII.\n\n'The New World shook him off; the Old yet groans\nBeneath what he and his prepared, if not\nCompleted: he leaves heirs on many thrones\nTo all his vices, without what begot\nCompassion for him \u2014 his tame virtues; drones\nWho sleep, or despots who have not forgot\nA lesson which shall be re-taught them, wake\nUpon the thrones of earth; but let them quake!\nXLVIII.\n\n'Five millions of the primitive, who hold\nThe faith which makes ye great on earth, implored\nA part of that vast all they held of old, \u2014\nFreedom to worship \u2014 not alone your Lord,\nMichael, but you, and you, Saint Peter! Cold\nMust be your souls, if you have not abhorr'd\nThe foe to Catholic participatio n\nIn all the license of a Christian nation.\n\nXLIX.\n\n'True! he allow'd them to pray God; but as\nA consequence of prayer, refused the law\nWhich would have placed them upon the same base\nWith those who did not hold the saints in awe.\n\nBut here Saint Peter started from his place,\nAnd cried, 'You may the prisoner withdraw:\nEre heaven shall ope her portals to this Guelph,\nWhile I am guard, may I be damn'd myself!\nL.\n\n'Sooner will I with Cerberus exchange\nMy office (and his no sinecure)\nThan see this royal Bedlam bigot range\nThe azure fields of heaven, of that be sure!'\n'Saint!' replied Satan, 'you do well to avenge\nThe wrongs he made your satellites endure;\nAnd if to this exchange you should be given,\nI'll try to coax our Cerberus up to heaven!'\nLI.\n\nHere Michael interposed: 'Good saint! and devil!\nPray, not so fast; you both outrun discretion.\n\nSaint Peter! you were wont to be more civil!\nSatan! excuse this warmth of his expression,\nAnd condescensio n to the vulgar's level:\nEvent saints sometimes forget themselves in session.\n\nHave you got more to say?\n\n'--'No.\n\n'--If you please\nI'll trouble you to call your witnesses.\n\nLII.\n\nThen Satan turn'd and waved his swarthy hand,\nWhich stirr'd with its electric qualities\nClouds farther off than we can understand,\nAlthough we find him sometimes in our skies;\nInfernal thunder shook both sea and land\nIn all the planets, and hell's batteries\nLet off the artillery, which Milton mentions\nAs one of Satan's most sublime inventions.\n\nLIII.\n\nThis was a signal unto such damn'd souls\nAs have the privilege of their damnation\nExtended far beyond the mere controls\nOf worlds past, present, or to come; no station\nIs theirs particularly in the rolls\nOf hell assign'd; but where their inclination\nOr business carries them in search of game,\nThey may range freely--being damn'd the same.\n\nLIV.\n\nThey're proud of this--as very well they may,\nIt being a sort of knighthood, or gilt key\nStuck in their loins; or like to an 'entr\u00e9'\nUp the back stairs, or such free-masonry.\n\nI borrow my comparisons from clay,\nBeing clay myself.\n\nLet not those spirits be\nOffended with such base low likenesses;\nWe know their posts are nobler far than these.\n\nLV.\n\nWhen the great signal ran from heaven to hell--\nAbout ten million times the distance reckon'd\nFrom our sun to its earth, as we can tell\nHow much time it takes up, even to a second,\nFor every ray that travels to dispel\nThe fogs of London, through which, dimly beacon'd,\nThe weathercocks\u00a0 are gilt some thrice a year,\nIf that the summer is not too severe;\nLVI.\n\nI say that I can tell--'twas half a minute;\nI know the solar beams take up more time\nEre, pack'd up for their journey, they begin it;\nBut then their telegraph is less sublime,\nAnd if they ran a race, they would not win it\n'Gainst Satan's couriers bound for their own clime.\n\nThe sun takes up some years for every ray\nTo reach its goal \u2014 the devil not half a day.\n\nLVII.\n\nUpon the verge of space, about the size\nOf half-a-crown , a little speck appear'd\n(I've seen a something like it in the skies\nIn the \u00c6gean, ere a squall); it near'd,\nAnd growing bigger, took another guise;\nLike an a\u00ebrial ship it tack'd, and steer'd,\nOr was steer'd (I am doubtful of the grammar\nOf the last phrase, which makes the stanza stammer;--\nLVIII.\n\nBut take your choice): and then it grew a cloud;\nAnd so it was \u2014 a cloud of witnesses.\n\nBut such a cloud! No land e'er saw a crowd\nOf locusts numerous as the heavens saw these;\nThey shadow'd with their myriads space; their loud\nAnd varied cries were like those of wild geese\n(If nations may be liken'd to a goose),\nAnd realised the phrase of 'hell broke loose.\n\nLIX.\n\nHere crash'd a sturdy oath of stout John Bull,\nWho damn'd away his eyes as heretofore:\nThere Paddy brogued, 'By Jasus!'--'What's your wull?\n\nThe temperate Scot exclaim'd: the French ghost swore\nIn certain terms I shan't translate in full,\nAs the first coachman will; and 'midst the roar,\nThe voice of Jonathan was heard to express,\n'Our president is going to war, I guess.\n\nLX.\n\nBesides there were the Spaniard, Dutch, and Dane;\nIn short, an universal shoal of shades,\nFrom Otaheite's isle to Salisbury Plain,\nOf all climes and professions,\u00a0 years and trades,\nReady to swear against the good king's reign,\nBitter as clubs in cards are against spades:\nAll summon'd by this grand 'subpoena,' to\nTry if kings mayn't be damn'd like me or you.\n\nLXI.\n\nWhen Michael saw this host, he first grew pale,\nAs angels can; next, like Italian twilight,\nHe turn'd all colours \u2014 as a peacock's tail,\nOr sunset streaming through a Gothic skylight\nIn some old abbey, or a trout not stale,\nOr distant lightning on the horizon by night,\nOr a fresh rainbow, or a grand review\nOf thirty regiments in red, green, and blue.\n\nLXII.\n\nThen he address'd himself to Satan: 'Why \u2014\nMy good old friend, for such I deem you, though\nOur different parties make us fight so shy,\nI ne'er mistake you for a personal foe;\nOur difference is political, and I\nTrust that, whatever may occur below,\nYou know my great respect for you; and this\nMakes me regret whate'er you do amiss \u2014\nLXIII.\n\n'Why, my dear Lucifer, would you abuse\nMy call for witnesses?\n\nI did not mean\nThat you should half of earth and hell produce;\n'Tis even superfluous,\u00a0 since two honest, clean\nTrue testimonies are enough: we lose\nOur time, nay, our eternity, between\nThe accusation and defence: if we\nHear both, 'twill stretch our immortality.\n\nLXIV.\n\nSatan replied, 'To me the matter is\nIndifferent, in a personal point of view;\nI can have fifty better souls than this\nWith far less trouble than we have gone through\nAlready; and I merely argued his\nLate majesty of Britain's case with you\nUpon a point of form: you may dispose\nOf him; I've kings enough below, God knows!'\nLXV.\n\nThus spoke the Demon (late call'd 'multifaced'\nBy multo-scribbling Southey).\n\n'Then we'll call\nOne or two persons of the myriads placed\nAround our congress, and dispense with all\nThe rest,' quoth Michael: 'Who may be so graced\nAs to speak first?\n\nthere's choice enough--who shall\nIt be?\n\n' Then Satan answer'd, 'There are many;\nBut you may choose Jack Wilkes as well as any.\n\nLXVI.\n\nA merry, cock-eyed, curious-look ing sprite\nUpon the instant started from the throng,\nDress'd in a fashion now forgotten quite;\nFor all the fashions of the flesh stick long\nBy people in the next world; where unite\nAll the costumes since Adam's, right or wrong,\nFrom Eve's fig-leaf down to the petticoat,\nAlmost as scanty, of days less remote.\n\nLXVII.\n\nThe spirit look'd around upon the crowds\nAssembled, and exclaim'd, 'My friends of all\nThe spheres, we shall catch cold amongst these clouds;\nSo let's to business: why this general call?\n\nIf those are freeholders I see in shrouds,\nAnd 'tis for an election that they bawl,\nBehold a candidate with unturn'd coat!\nSaint Peter, may I count upon your vote?\n\nLXVIII.\n\n'Sir,' replied Michael, 'you mistake; these things\nAre of a former life, and what we do\nAbove is more august; to judge of kings\nIs the tribunal met: so now you know.\n\n'Then I presume those gentlemen with wings,'\nSaid Wilkes, 'are cherubs; and that soul below\nLooks much like George the Third, but to my mind\nA good deal older \u2014 Bless me!

'twere best--\nNon Di, non homines \u2014- you know the rest.\n\nXCII.\n\nA general bustle spread throughout the throng.\n\nWhich seem'd to hold all verse in detestation;\nThe angels had of course enough of song\nWhen upon service; and the generation\nOf ghosts had heard too much in life, not long\nBefore, to profit by a new occasion;\nThe monarch, mute till then, exclaim'd, 'What! What!\nPye come again?\n\nNo more \u2014 no more of that!'\nXCIII.\n\nThe tumult grew; an universal cough\nConvulsed the skies, as during a debate\nWhen Castlereagh has been up long enough\n(Before he was first minister of state,\nI mean \u2014 the slaves hear now); some cried 'off, off!'\nAs at a farce; till, grown quite desperate,\nThe bard Saint Peter pray'd to interpose\n(Himself an author) only for his prose.\n\nXCIV.\n\nThe varlet was not an ill-favour'd\u00a0 knave;\nA good deal like a vulture in the face,\nWith a hook nose and a hawk'd eye, which gave\nA smart and sharper-look ing sort of grace\nTo his whole aspect, which, though rather grave,\nWas by no means so ugly as his case;\nBut that, indeed, was hopeless as can be,\nQuite a poetic felony, 'de se.\n\nXCV.\n\nThen Michael blew his trump, and still'd the noise\nWith one still greater, as is yet the mode\nOn earth besides; except some grumbling voice,\nWhich now and then will make a slight inroad\nUpon decorous silence, few will twice\nLift up their lungs when fairly overcrow'd;\nAnd now the bard could plead his own bad cause,\nWith all the attitudes of self-applause.\n\nXCVI.\n\nHe said \u2014 (I only give the heads) \u2014 he said,\nHe meant no harm in scribbling;

 thereby adding to his other laurels, the ambition of those of an informer.\n\nIf there exists anywhere, except in his imagination,  such a School, is he not sufficiently  armed against it by his own intense vanity?\n\nThe truth is, that there are certain writers whom Mr.\n\nS.\n\nimagines, like Scrub, to have 'talked of him; for they have laughed consumedly.\n\nI think I know enough of most of the writers to whom he is supposed to allude, to assert, that they, in their individual capacities, have done more good, in the charities of life, to their fellow-creat ures, in any one year, than Mr.\n\nSouthey has done harm to himself by his absurdities in his whole life; and this is saying a great deal.\n\nBut I have a few questions to ask.\n\n1stly, Is Mr.\n\nSouthey the author of 'Wat Tyler'?\n\n2ndly, Was he not refused a remedy at law by the highest judge of his beloved England, because it was a blasphemous and seditious publication?\n\n3rdly, Was he not entitled by William Smith, in full Parliament, 'a rancorous renegado'?\n\n4thly, Is he not poet laureate, with his own lines on Martin the regicide staring him in the face?\n\nAnd 5thly, Putting the four preceding items together, with what conscience dare he call the attention of the laws to the publications  of others, be they what they may?\n\nI say nothing of the cowardice of such a proceeding, its meanness speaks for itself; but I wish to touch upon the motive, which is neither more nor less than that Mr.\n\nS.\n\nhas been laughed at a little in some recent publications , as he was of yore in the 'Anti-jacobi n,' by his present patrons.\n\nHence all this 'skimble-sca mble stuff' about 'Satanic,' and so forth.\n\nHowever, it is worthy of him \u2014 'qualis ab incepto.\n\nIf there is anything obnoxious to the political opinions of a portion of the public in the following poem, they may thank Mr.\n\nSouthey.\n\nHe might have written hexameters, as he has written everything else, for aught that the writer cared \u2014 had they been upon another subject.\n\nBut to attempt to canonise a monarch, who, whatever where his household virtues, was neither a successful nor a patriot king, \u2014 inasmuch as several years of his reign passed in war with America and Ireland, to say nothing of the aggression upon France, \u2014 like all other exaggeration , necessarily begets opposition.\n\nIn whatever manner he may be spoken of in this new 'Vision,' his public career will not be more favourably transmitted by history.\n\nOf his private virtues (although a little expense to the nation) there can be no doubt.\n\nWith regard to the supernatural  personages treated of, I can only say that I know as much about them, and (as an honest man) have a better right to talk of them than Robert Southey.\n\nI have also treated them more tolerantly.\n\nThe way in which that poor insane creature, the Laureate, deals about his judgments in the next world, is like his own judgment in this.\n\nIf it was not completely ludicrous, it would be something worse.\n\nI don't think that there is much more to say at present.\n\nQUEVEDO REDIVIVUS\nP.\n\nS.\n\n\u2014 It is possible that some readers may object, in these objectionabl e times, to the freedom with which saints, angels, and spiritual persons discourse in this 'Vision.\n\n' But, for precedents upon such points, I must refer him to Fielding's 'Journey from the World to the next,' and to the Visions of myself, the said Quevedo, in Spanish or translated.\n\nThe reader is also requested to observe, that no doctrinal tenets are insisted upon or discussed; that the person of the Deity is carefully withheld from sight, which is more than can be said for the Laureate, who hath thought proper to make him talk, not 'like a school-divin e,' but like the unscholarlik e Mr.\n\nSouthey.\n\nThe whole action passes on the outside of heaven; and Chaucer's 'Wife of Bath,' Pulci's 'Morgante Maggiore,' Swift's 'Tale of a Tub,' and the other\nworks above referred to, are cases in point of the freedom with which saints, &c.\n\nmay be permitted to converse in works not intended to be serious.\n\nQ.\n\nR.\n\n* Mr.\n\nSouthey being, as he says, a good Christian and vindictive, threatens, I understand, a reply to this our answer.\n\nIt is to be hoped that his visionary faculties will be in the mean time have acquired a little more judgment, properly so called: otherwise he will get himself into new dilemmas.\n\nThese apostate jacobins furnish rich rejoinders.\n\nLet him take a specimen.\n\nMr.\n\nSouthey laudeth grievously 'one Mr.\n\nLandor,' who cultivates much prevate renown in the shape of Latin verses; and not long ago, the poet laureate dedicated to him, it appeareth, one of his fugitive lyrics, upon the strength of a poem called 'Gebir.\n\n' Who could suppose, that in this same Gebir the aforesaid Savage Landor (for such is his grim cognomen) putteth into the infernal regions no less a person than the hero of his friend Mr.\n\nSouthey's heaven, \u2014 yea, even George the Third! See also how personal Savage becometh, when he hath a mind.\n\nThe following is his portrait of our late gracious sovereign:\n(Prince Gebir having descended into the infernal regions, the shades of his royal ancestors are, at his request, called up to his view; and he exclaims to\nhis ghostly guide) \u2014\n'Aroar, what wretch that nearest us?\n\nwhat wretch\nIs that with eyebrows white and slanting brow?\n\nListen! him yonder who, bound down supine,\nShrinks yelling from that sword there, engine-hung.\n\nHe too amongst my ancestors! I hate\nThe despot, but the dastard I despise.\n\nWas he our countryman?\n\n'Alas, O king!\nIberia bore him, but the breed accurst\nInclement winds blew blighting from north-east.\n\n'He was a warrior then, nor fear'd the gods?\n\n'Gebir, he fear'd the demons, not the gods,\nThough them indeed his daily face adored:\nAnd was no warrior, yet the thousand lives\nSquander'd, as stones to exercise a sling,\nAnd the tame cruelty and cold caprice \u2014\nOh madness of mankind! address'd, adored!'\nGebir, p.\n\n28.\n\nI omit noticing some edifying Ithyphallics  of Savagius, wishing to keep the proper veil over them, if his grave but somewhat indiscreet worshipper will suffer it; but certainly these teachers of 'great moral lessons' are apt to be found in strange company.\n", "period": "Romantic", "literary_movement": "Romanticism", "register": "Formal", "rhetorical_genre": "Epideictic", "discursive_structure": "Monologue", "discourse_type": "Poetic", "narrative_level": "Extradiegetic", "diegetic_mimetic": NaN, "focalization": "Third person omniscient", "person": NaN, "deictic_orientation": NaN, "addressee_type": "General", "deictic_object": NaN, "temporal_orientation": "Future", "temporal_structure": "Linear", "tradition": "British Romanticism", "mode": "Narrative", "genre": "Epic", "stanza_structure": "Quatrains", "meter": "Iambic pentameter", "rhyme": "AABB"}

record.\n\nSuch a sleep\nThey sleep\u2014the men I loved.\n\nI think that we\nShall never more, at any future time,\nDelight our souls with talk of knightly deeds,\nWalking about the gardens and the halls\nOf Camelot, as in the days that were.\n\nI perish by this people which I made,\u2014\nTho' Merlin sware that I should come again\nTo rule once more\u2014but let what will be, be,\nI am so deeply smitten thro' the helm\nThat without help I cannot last till morn.\n\nThou therefore take my brand Excalibur,\nWhich was my pride: for thou rememberest how\nIn those old days, one summer noon, an arm\nRose up from out the bosom of the lake,\nClothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,\nHolding the sword\u2014and how I row'd across\nAnd took it, and have worn it, like a king:\nAnd, wheresoever I am sung or told\nIn aftertime, this also shall be known:\nBut now delay not: take Excalibur,\nAnd fling him far into the middle mere:\nWatch what thou se\u00ebst, and lightly bring me word.\n\n\nTo him replied the bold Sir Bedivere:\n\"It is not meet, Sir King, to leave thee thus,\nAidless, alone, and smitten thro' the helm.\n\nA little thing may harm a wounded man.\n\nYet I thy hest will all perform at full,\nWatch what I see, and lightly bring thee word.\n\n\nSo saying, from the ruin'd shrine he stept\nAnd in the moon athwart the place of tombs,\nWhere lay the mighty bones of ancient men,\nOld knights, and over them the sea-wind sang\nShrill, chill, with flakes of foam.\n\nHe, stepping down\nBy zigzag paths, and juts of pointed rock,\nCame on the shining levels of the lake.\n\nThere drew he forth the brand Excalibur,\nAnd o'er him, drawing it, the winter moon,\nBrightening the skirts of a long cloud, ran forth\nAnd sparkled keen with frost against the hilt:\nFor all the haft twinkled with diamond sparks,\nMyriads of topaz-lights, and jacinth work\nOf subtlest jewellery.\n\nHe gazed so long\nThat both his eyes were dazzled, as he stood,\nThis way and that dividing the swift mind,\nIn act to throw: but at the last it seem'd\nBetter to leave Excalibur conceal'd\nThere in the many-knotted water-flags,\nThat whistled stiff and dry about the marge.\n\nSo strode he back slow to the wounded King.\n\nThen spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:\n\"Hast thou perform'd my mission which I gave?\n\nWhat is it thou hast seen, or what hast heard?\n\n\nAnd answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:\n\"I heard the ripple washing in the reeds,\nAnd the wild water lapping on the crag.\n\n\nTo whom replied King Arthur, faint and pale:\n\"Thou hast betray'd thy nature and thy name,\nNot rendering true answer, as beseem'd\nThy fealty, nor like a noble knight:\nFor surer sign had follow'd, either hand,\nOr voice, or else a motion of the mere.\n\nThis is a shameful thing for men to lie.\n\nYet now, I charge thee, quickly go again\nAs thou art lief and dear, and do the thing\nI bade thee, watch, and lightly bring me word.\n\n\nThen went Sir Bedivere the second time\nAcross the ridge, and paced beside the mere,\nCounting the dewy pebbles, fixed in thought;\nBut when he saw the wonder of the hilt,\nHow curiously and strangely chased, he smote\nHis palms together, and he cried aloud,\n\n\"And if indeed I cast the brand away,\nSurely a precious thing, one worthy note,\nShould thus be lost forever from the earth,\nWhich might have pleased the eyes of many men.\n\nWhat good should follow this, if this were done?\n\nWhat harm, undone?\n\ndeep harm to disobey,\nSeeing obedience is the bond of rule.\n\nWere it well to obey then, if a king demand\nAn act unprofitable, against himself?\n\nThe King is sick, and knows not what he does.\n\nWhat record, or what relic of my lord\nShould be to aftertime, but empty breath\nAnd rumours of a doubt?\n\nbut were this kept,\nStored in some treasure-house of mighty kings,\nSome one might show it at a joust of arms,\nSaying, 'King Arthur's sword, Excalibur,\nWrought by the lonely maiden of the Lake;\nNine years she wrought it, sitting in the deeps\nUpon the hidden bases of the hills.\n\nSo might some old man speak in the aftertime\nTo all the people, winning reverence.\n\nBut now much honour and much fame were lost.\n\n\nSo spake he, clouded with his own conceit,\nAnd hid Excalibur the second time,\nAnd so strode back slow to the wounded King.\n\nThen spoke King Arthur, breathing heavily:\n\"What is it thou hast seen, or what hast heard?\n\n\nAnd answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:\n\"I heard the water lapping on the crag,\nAnd the long ripple washing in the reeds.\n\n\nTo whom replied King Arthur, much in wrath:\n\"Ah, miserable and unkind, untrue,\nUnknightly, traitor-hearted! Woe is me!\nAuthority forgets a dying king,\nLaid widow'd of the power in his eye\nThat bow'd the will.\n\nI see thee what thou art,\nFor thou, the latest-left of all my knights,\nIn whom should meet the offices of all,\nThou wouldst betray me for the precious hilt;\nEither from lust of gold, or like a girl\nValuing the giddy pleasure of the eyes.\n\nYet, for a man may fail in duty twice,\nAnd the third time may prosper, get thee hence:\nBut, if thou spare to fling Excalibur,\nI will arise and slay thee with my hands.\n\n\nThen quickly rose Sir Bedivere, and ran,\nAnd, leaping down the ridges lightly, plunged\nAmong the bulrush-beds, and clutch'd the sword,\nAnd strongly wheel'd and threw it.\n\nThe great brand\nMade lightnings in the splendour of the moon,\nAnd flashing round and round, and whirl'd in an arch,\nShot like a streamer of the northern morn,\nSeen where the moving isles of winter shock\nBy night, with noises of the northern sea.\n\nSo flash'd and fell the brand Excalibur:\nBut ere he dipt the surface, rose an arm\nClothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,\nAnd caught him by the hilt, and brandish'd him\nThree times, and drew him under in the mere.\n\nAnd lightly went the other to the King.\n\nThen spoke King Arthur, drawing thicker breath:\n\"Now see I by thine eyes that this is done.\n\nSpeak out: what is it thou hast heard, or seen?\n\n\nAnd answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:\n\"Sir King, I closed mine eyelids, lest the gems\nShould blind my purpose, for I never saw,\nNor shall see, here or elsewhere, till I die,\nNot tho' I live three lives of mortal men,\nSo great a miracle as yonder hilt.\n\nThen with both hands I flung him, wheeling him;\nBut when I look'd again, behold an arm,\nClothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,\nThat caught him by the hilt, and brandish'd him\nThree times, and drew him under in the mere.\n\n\nAnd answer made King Arthur, breathing hard:\n\"My end draws nigh; 't is time that I were gone.\n\nMake broad thy shoulders to receive my weight,\nAnd bear me to the margin; yet I fear\nMy wound hath taken cold, and I shall die.\n\n\nSo saying, from the pavement he half rose,\nSlowly, with pain, reclining on his arm,\nAnd looking wistfully with wide blue eyes\nAs in a picture.\n\nHim Sir Bedivere\nRemorsefully regarded thro' his tears,\nAnd would have spoken, but he found not words,\nThen took with care, and kneeling on one knee,\nO'er both his shoulders drew the languid hands,\nAnd rising bore him thro' the place of tombs.\n\nBut, as he walk'd, King Arthur panted hard,\nLike one that feels a nightmare on his bed\nWhen all the house is mute.\n\nSo sigh'd the King\nMuttering and murmuring at his ear, \"Quick, quick!\nI fear it is too late, and I shall die.\n\nBut the other swiftly strode from ridge to ridge,\nClothed with his breath, and looking, as he walk'd\nLarger than human on the frozen hills.\n\nHe heard the deep behind him, and a cry\nBefore.\n\nHis own thought drove him like a goad.\n\nDry clash'd his harness in the icy caves\nAnd barren chasms, and all to left and right\nThe bare black cliff clang'd round him, as he based\nHis feet on juts of slippery crag that rang\nSharp-smitten with the dint of armed heels\u2014\nAnd on a sudden, lo! the level lake,\nAnd the long glories of the winter moon.\n\nThen saw they how there hove a dusky barge\nDark as a funeral scarf from stem to stern,\nBeneath them; and descending they were ware\nThat all the decks were dense with stately forms\nBlack-stoled, black-hooded, like a dream\u2014by these\nThree Queens with crowns of gold\u2014and from them rose\nA cry that shiver'd to the tingling stars,\nAnd, as it were one voice, an agony\nOf lamentation, like a wind, that shrills\nAll night in a waste land, where no one comes,\nOr hath come, since the making of the world.\n\nThen murmur'd Arthur, \"Place me in the barge,\"\nAnd to the barge they came.\n\nThere those three Queens\nPut forth their hands, and took the King, and wept.\n\nBut she that rose the tallest of them all\nAnd fairest, laid his head upon her lap,\nAnd loosed the shatter'd casque, and chafed his hands,\nAnd call'd him by his name, complaining loud\nAnd dropping bitter tears against his brow\nStriped with dark blood: for all his face was white\nAnd colourless, and like the wither'd moon\nSmote by the fresh beam of the springing east;\nAnd all his greaves and cuisses dash'd with drops\nOf onset; and the light and lustrous curls\u2014\nThat made his forehead like a rising sun\nHigh from the da\u00efs-throne\u2014were parch'd with dust;\nOr, clotted into points and hanging loose,\nMix'd with the knightly growth that fringed his lips.\n\nSo like a shatter'd column lay the King;\nNot like that Arthur who, with lance in rest,\nFrom spur to plume a star of tournament,\nShot thro' the lists at Camelot, and charged\nBefore the eyes of ladies and of kings.\n\nThen loudly cried the bold Sir Bedivere:\n\"Ah! my Lord Arthur, whither shall I go?\n\nWhere shall I hide my forehead and my eyes?\n\nFor now I see the true old times are dead,\nWhen every morning brought a noble chance,\nAnd every chance brought out a noble knight.\n\nSuch times have been not since the light that led\nThe holy Elders with the gift of myrrh.\n\nBut now the whole ROUND TABLE is dissolved\nWhich was an image of the mighty world;\nAnd I, the last, go forth companionless,\nAnd the days darken round me, and the years,\nAmong new men, strange faces, other minds.\n\n\nAnd slowly answer'd Arthur from the barge:\n\"The old order changeth, yielding place to new,\nAnd God fulfils Himself in many ways,\nLest one good custom should corrupt the world.\n\nComfort thyself: what comfort is in me?\n\nI have lived my life, and that which I have done\nMay He within Himself make pure! but thou,\nIf thou shouldst never see my face again,\nPray for my soul.\n\nMore things are wrought by prayer\nThan this world dreams of.\n\nWherefore, let thy voice\nRise like a fountain for me night and day.\n\nFor what are men better than sheep or goats\nThat nourish a blind life within the brain,\nIf, knowing God, they lift not hands of prayer\nBoth for themselves and those who call them friend?\n\nFor so the whole round earth is every way\nBound by gold chains about the feet of God.\n\nBut now farewell.\n\nI am going a long way\nWith these thou se\u00ebst\u2014if indeed I go\u2014\n(For all my mind is clouded with a doubt)\nTo the island-valley of Avilion;\nWhere falls not hail, or rain, or any snow,\nNor ever wind blows loudly; but it lies\nDeep-meadow'd, happy, fair with orchard-lawns\nAnd bowery hollows crown'd with summer sea,\nWhere I will heal me of my grievous wound.\n\n\nSo said he, and the barge with oar and sail\nMoved from the brink, like some full-breasted swan\nThat, fluting a wild carol ere her death,\nRuffles her pure cold plume, and takes the flood\nWith swarthy webs.\n\nLong stood Sir Bedivere\nRevolving many memories, till the hull\nLook'd one black dot against the verge of dawn,\nAnd on the mere the wailing died away.\n", "period": "Victorian", "literary_movement": "Romanticism", "register": "Formal", "rhetorical_genre": "Epideictic", "discursive_structure": "Narrative", "discourse_type": "Expository", "narrative_level": "Third person", "diegetic_mimetic": "Mimetic", "focalization": "Omniscient", "person": NaN, "deictic_orientation": "Third person", "addressee_type": "General", "deictic_object": NaN, "temporal_orientation": "Past", "temporal_structure": "Chronological", "tradition": "British", "mode": "Narrative", "genre": "Epic", "stanza_structure": "Quatrains", "meter": "Iambic pentameter", "rhyme": "AABB"}

ah, why\nShould life all labour be?\n\nLet us alone.\n\nTime driveth onward fast,\nAnd in a little while our lips are dumb.\n\nLet us alone.\n\nWhat is it that will last?\n\nPortions and parcels of the dreadful past.\n\nLet us alone.\n\nWhat pleasure can we have\nTo war with evil?\n\nIs there any peace\nIn ever climbing up the climbing wave?\n\nAll things have rest, and ripen toward the grave\nIn silence;

I fancied Cuthbert's reddening face\nBeneath its garniture of curly gold,\nDear fellow, till I almost felt him fold\nAn arm in mine to fix me to the place,\nThat way he used.\n\nAlas, one night's disgrace!\nOut went my heart's new fire and left it cold.\n\nXVII.\n\nGiles then, the soul of honour\u2014-there he stands\nFrank as ten years ago when knighted first.\n\nWhat honest man should dare (he said) he durst.\n\nGood\u2014-but the scene shifts\u2014-faugh! what hangman hands\nPin to his breast a parchment?\n\nHis own bands\nRead it.\n\nPoor traitor, spit upon and curst!\nXVIII.\n\nBetter this present than a past like that;\nBack therefore to my darkening path again!\nNo sound, no sight as far as eye could strain.\n\nWill the night send a howlet or a bat?\n\nI asked: when something on the dismal flat\nCame to arrest my thoughts and change their train.\n\nXIX.\n\nA sudden little river crossed my path\nAs unexpected as a serpent comes.\n\nNo sluggish tide congenial to the glooms;\nThis, as it frothed by, might have been a bath\nFor the fiend's glowing hoof\u2014-to see the wrath\nOf its black eddy bespate with flakes and spumes.\n\nXX.\n\nSo petty yet so spiteful! All along,\nLow scrubby alders kneeled down over it;\nDrenched willows flung them headlong in a fit\nOf route despair, a suicidal throng:\nThe river which had done them all the wrong,\nWhate'er that was, rolled by, deterred no whit.\n\nXXI.\n\nWhich, while I forded,\u2014-good saints, how I feared\nTo set my foot upon a dead man's cheek,\nEach step, or feel the spear I thrust to seek\nFor hollows, tangled in his hair or beard!\n\u2014-It may have been a water-rat I speared,\nBut, ugh! it sounded like a baby's shriek.\n\nXXII.\n\nGlad was I when I reached the other bank.\n\nNow for a better country.\n\nVain presage!\nWho were the strugglers, what war did they wage,\nWhose savage trample thus could pad the dank\nSoil to a plash?\n\nToads in a poisoned tank,\nOr wild cats in a red-hot iron cage\u2014-\nXXIII.\n\nThe fight must so have seemed in that fell cirque.\n\nWhat penned them there, with all the plain to choose?\n\nNo foot-print leading to that horrid mews,\nNone out of it.\n\nMad brewage set to work\nTheir brains, no doubt, like galley-slaves the Turk\nPits for his pastime, Christians against Jews.\n\nXXIV.\n\nAnd more than that\u2014-a furlong on\u2014-why, there!\nWhat bad use was that engine for, that wheel,\nOr brake, not wheel\u2014-that harrow fit to reel\nMen's bodies out like silk?\n\nwith all the air\nOf Tophet's tool, on earth left unaware,\nOr brought to sharpen its rusty teeth of steel.\n\nXXV.\n\nThen came a bit of stubbed ground, once a wood,\nNext a marsh, it would seem, and now mere earth\nDesperate and done with; (so a fool finds mirth,\nMakes a thing and then mars it, till his mood\nChanges and off he goes!) within a rood\u2014-\nBog, clay and rubble, sand and stark black dearth.\n\nXXVI.\n\nNow blotches rankling, coloured gay and grim,\nNow patches where some leanness of the soil's\nBroke into moss or substances like boils;\nThen came some palsied oak, a cleft in him\nLike a distorted mouth that splits its rim\nGaping at death, and dies while it recoils.\n\nXXVII.\n\nAnd just as far as ever from the end!\nNought in the distance but the evening, nought\nTo point my footstep further! At the thought,\ngreat black bird, Apollyon's bosom-friend,\nSailed past, nor beat his wide wing dragon-penned\nThat brushed my cap\u2014-perchance the guide I sought.\n\nXXVIII.\n\nFor, looking up, aware I somehow grew,\n'Spite of the dusk, the plain had given place\nAll round to mountains\u2014-with\nsuch name to grace\nMere ugly heights and heaps now stolen in view.\n\nHow thus they had surprised me,\u2014-solve it, you!\nHow to get from them was no clearer case.\n\nXXIX.\n\nYet half I seemed to recognize some trick\nOf mischief happened to me, God knows when\u2014-\nIn a bad dream perhaps.\n\nHere ended, then,\nProgress this way.\n\nWhen, in the very nick\nOf giving up, one time more, came a click\nAs when a trap shuts\u2014-you're inside the den!\nXXX.\n\nBurningly it came on me all at once,\nThis was the place! those two hills on the right,\nCrouched like two bulls locked horn in horn in fight;\nWhile to the left, a tall scalped mountain\u2026 Dunce,\nDotard, a-dozing at the very nonce,\nAfter a life spent training for the sight!\nXXXI.\n\nWhat in the midst lay but the Tower itself?\n\nThe round squat turret, blind as the fool's heart,\nBuilt of brown stone, without a counter-part\nIn the whole world.\n\nThe tempest's mocking elf\nPoints to the shipman thus the unseen shelf\nHe strikes on, only when the timbers start.\n\nXXXII.\n\nNot see?\n\nbecause of night perhaps?\n\n\u2014-why, day\nCame back again for that! before it left,\nThe dying sunset kindled through a cleft:\nThe hills, like giants at a hunting, lay,\nChin upon hand, to see the game at bay,\u2014-\n``Now stab and end the creature\u2014-to the heft!''\nXXXIII.\n\nNot hear?\n\nwhen noise was everywhere! it tolled\nIncreasing like a bell.\n\nNames in my ears\nOf all the lost adventurers my peers,\u2014-\nHow such a one was strong, and such was bold,\nAnd such was fortunate, yet, each of old\nLost, lost! one moment knelled the woe of years.\n\nXXXIV.\n\nThere they stood, ranged along the hill-sides, met\nTo view the last of me, a living frame\nFor one more picture! in a sheet of flame\nI saw them and I knew them all.\n\nAnd yet\nDauntless the slug-horn to my lips I set,\nAnd blew.\n\nChilde Roland to the Dark Tower came.\n", "period": "Victorian", "literary_movement": "Victorianism", "register": "Formal", "rhetorical_genre": "Epideictic", "discursive_structure": "Monologue", "discourse_type": "Expository", "narrative_level": "Third person limited", "diegetic_mimetic": "Realistic", "focalization": "External", "person": "Third person", "deictic_orientation": "Past", "addressee_type": "Implied", "deictic_object": "Dark Tower", "temporal_orientation": "Past", "temporal_structure": "Linear", "tradition": "British Romanticism", "mode": "Narrative", "genre": "Epic", "stanza_structure": "Quatrains", "meter": "Iambic pentameter", "rhyme": "AABB"}

Give your brains a racking\nTo find the remedy we're lacking,\nOr, sure as fate, we'll send you packing!\nAt this the Mayor and Corporation\nQuaked with a mighty consternation.\n\nAn hour they sate in council,\nAt length the Mayor broke silence:\nFor a guilder I'd my ermine gown sell;\nI wish I were a mile hence!\nIt's easy to bid one rack one's brain \u2014\nI'm sure my poor head aches again\nI've scratched it so, and all in vain.\n\nOh for a trap, a trap, a trap!\nJust as he said this, what should hap\nAt the chamber door but a gentle tap?\n\nBless us, cried the Mayor, what's that?\n\n(With the Corporation as he sate,\nLooking little though wondrous fat);\nOnly a scraping of shoes on the mat?\n\nAnything like the sound of a rat\nMakes my heart go pit-a-pat!\n\nCome in! \u2014 the Mayor cried, looking bigger:\nAnd in did come the strangest figure!\nHis queer long coat from heel to head\nWas half of yellow and half of red;\nAnd he himself was tall and thin,\nWith sharp blue eyes, each like a pin,\nAnd light loose hair, yet swarthy skin,\nNo tuft on cheek nor beard on chin,\nBut lips where smiles went out and in \u2014\nThere was no guessing his kith and kin!\nAnd nobody could enough admire\nThe tall man and his quaint attire:\nQuoth one: It's as my great-grandsire,\nStarting up at the Trump of Doom's tone,\nHad walked this way from his painted tombstone!\n\nHe advanced to the council-table:\nAnd, Please your honours, said he, I'm able,\nBy means of a secret charm, to draw\nAll creatures living beneath the sun,\nThat creep, or swim, or fly, or run,\nAfter me so as you never saw!\nAnd I chiefly use my charm\nOn creatures that do people harm,\nThe mole, and toad, and newt, and viper;\nAnd people call me the Pied Piper.\n\n(And here they noticed round his neck\nA scarf of red and yellow stripe,\nTo match with his coat of the self-same cheque;\nAnd at the scarf's end hung a pipe;\nAnd his fingers, they noticed, were ever straying\nAs if impatient to be playing\nUpon this pipe, as low it dangled\nOver his vesture so old-fangled.\n\nYet, said he, poor piper as I am,\nIn Tartary I freed the Cham,\nLast June, from his huge swarms of gnats;\nI eased in Asia the Nizam\nOf a monstrous brood of vampyre-bats:\nAnd, as for what your brain bewilders,\nIf I can rid your town of rats\nWill you give me a thousand guilders?\n\nOne?\n\nfifty thousand! \u2014 was the exclamation\nOf the astonished Mayor and Corporation.\n\nInto the street the Piper stept,\nSmiling first a little smile,\nAs if he knew what magic slept\nIn his quiet pipe the while;\nThen, like a musical adept,\nTo blow the pipe his lips he wrinkled,\nAnd green and blue his sharp eyes twinkled,\nLike a candle-flame where salt is sprinkled;\nAnd ere three shrill notes the pipe uttered,\nYou heard as if an army muttered;\nAnd the muttering grew to a grumbling;\nAnd the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling;\nAnd out of the houses the rats came tumbling.\n\nGreat rats, small rats, lean rats, brawny rats,\nBrown rats, black rats, grey rats, tawny rats,\nGrave old plodders, gay young friskers,\nFathers, mothers, uncles, cousins,\nCocking tails and pricking whiskers,\nFamilies by tens and dozens,\nBrothers, sisters, husbands, wives \u2014\nFollowed the Piper for their lives.\n\nFrom street to street he piped advancing,\nAnd step for step they followed dancing,\nUntil they came to the river Weser\nWherein all plunged and perished\n\u2014 Save one who, stout as Julius Caesar,\nSwam across and lived to carry\n(As he the manuscript he cherished)\nTo Rat-land home his commentary,\nWhich was, At the first shrill notes of the pipe,\nI heard a sound as of scraping tripe,\nAnd putting apples, wondrous ripe,\nInto a cider-press's gripe:\nAnd a moving away of pickle-tub-boards,\nAnd a leaving ajar of conserve-cupboards,\nAnd a drawing the corks of train-oil-flasks,\nAnd a breaking the hoops of butter-casks;\nAnd it seemed as if a voice\n(Sweeter than by harp or by psaltery\nIs breathed) called out, Oh rats, rejoice!\nThe world is grown to one vast drysaltery!\n'So munch on, crunch on, take your nuncheon,\n'Breakfast, supper, dinner, luncheon!\nAnd just as one bulky sugar-puncheon,\nReady staved, like a great sun shone\nGlorious scarce an inch before me,\nJust as methought it said, Come, bore me!\n\u2014 I found the Weser rolling o'er me.\n\nYou should have heard the Hamelin people\nRinging the bells till they rocked the steeple;\nGo, cried the Mayor, and get long poles!\nPoke out the nests and block up the holes!\nConsult with carpenters and builders,\nAnd leave in our town not even a trace\nOf the rats! \u2014 when suddenly up the face\nOf the Piper perked in the market-place,\nWith a, First, if you please, my thousand guilders!\n\nA thousand guilders! The Mayor looked blue;\nSo did the Corporation too.\n\nFor council dinners made rare havock\nWith Claret, Moselle, Vin-de-Grave, Hock;\nAnd half the money would replenish\nTheir cellar's biggest butt with Rhenish.\n\nTo pay this sum to a wandering fellow\nWith a gipsy coat of red and yellow!\nBeside, quoth the Mayor with a knowing wink,\nOur business was done at the river's brink;\nWe saw with our eyes the vermin sink,\nAnd what's dead can't come to life, I think.\n\nSo, friend, we're not the folks to shrink\nFrom the duty of giving you something for drink,\nAnd a matter of money to put in your poke;\nBut, as for the guilders, what we spoke\nOf them, as you very well know, was in joke.\n\nBeside, our losses have made us thrifty;\nA thousand guilders! Come, take fifty!\n\nThe Piper's face fell, and he cried,\nNo trifling! I can't wait, beside!\nI've promised to visit by dinner time\nBagdat, and accept the prime\nOf the Head Cook's pottage, all he's rich in,\nFor having left, in the Caliph's kitchen,\nOf a nest of scorpions no survivor \u2014\nWith him I proved no bargain-driver,\nWith you, don't think I'll bate a stiver!\nAnd folks who put me in a passion\nMay find me pipe after another fashion.\n\nHow?\n\ncried the Mayor, d'ye think I'll brook\nBeing worse treated than a Cook?\n\nInsulted by a lazy ribald\nWith idle pipe and vesture piebald?\n\nYou threaten us, fellow?\n\nDo your worst,\nBlow your pipe there till you burst!\n\nOnce more he stept into the street;\nAnd to his lips again\nLaid his long pipe of smooth straight cane;\nAnd ere he blew three notes (such sweet\nSoft notes as yet musician's cunning\nNever gave th'enraptured air)\nThere was a rustling, that seem'd like a bustling\nOf merry crowds justling at pitching and hustling,\nSmall feet were pattering, wooden shoes clattering,\nLittle hands clapping, and little tongues chattering,\nAnd, like fowls in a farm-yard when barley is scattering,\nOut came the children running.\n\nAll the little boys and girls,\nWith rosy cheeks and flaxen curls,\nAnd sparkling eyes and teeth like pearls,\nTripping and skipping, ran merrily after\nThe wonderful music with shouting and laughter.\n\nThe Mayor was dumb, and the Council stood\nAs if they were changed into blocks of wood,\nUnable to move a step, or cry\nTo the children merrily skipping by \u2014\nCould only follow with the eye\nThat joyous crowd at the Piper's back.\n\nBut how the Mayor was on the rack,\nAnd the wretched Council's bosoms beat,\nAs the Piper turned from the High Street\nTo where the Weser rolled its waters\nRight in the way of their sons and daughters!\nHowever he turned from South to West,\nAnd to Coppelburg Hill his steps addressed,\nAnd after him the children pressed;\nGreat was the joy in every breast.\n\nHe never can cross that mighty top!\nHe's forced to let the piping drop,\nAnd we shall see our children stop!\nWhen, lo, as they reached the mountain's side,\nA wondrous portal opened wide,\nAs if a cavern was suddenly hollowed;\nAnd the Piper advanced and the children follow'd,\nAnd when all were in to the very last,\nThe door in the mountain side shut fast.\n\nDid I say, all?\n\nNo! One was lame,\nAnd could not dance the whole of the way;\nAnd in after years, if you would blame\nHis sadness, he was used to say, \u2014\nIt's dull in our town since my playmates left!\nI can't forget that I'm bereft\nOf all the pleasant sights they see,\nWhich the Piper also promised me;\nFor he led us, he said, to a joyous land,\nJoining the town and just at hand,\nWhere waters gushed and fruit-trees grew,\nAnd flowers put forth a fairer hue,\nAnd every thing was strange and new;\nThe sparrows were brighter than peacocks here,\nAnd their dogs outran our fallow deer,\nAnd honey-bees had lost their stings,\nAnd horses were born with eagles' wings:\nAnd just as I felt assured\nMy lame foot would be speedily cured,\nThe music stopped and I stood still,\nAnd found myself outside the Hill,\nLeft alone against my will,\nTo go now limping as before,\nAnd never hear of that country more!\n\nAlas, alas for Hamelin!\nThere came into many a burgher's pate\nA text which says, that Heaven's Gate\nOpes to the Rich at as easy a rate\nAs the needle's eye takes a camel in!\nThe Mayor sent East, West, North, and South,\nTo offer the Piper, by word of mouth,\nWherever it was men's lot to find him,\nSilver and gold to his heart's content,\nIf he'd only return the way he went,\nAnd bring the children behind him.\n\nBut when they saw 'twas a lost endeavour,\nAnd Piper and dancers were gone for ever,\nThey made a decree that lawyers never\nShould think their records dated duly\nIf, after the day of the month and year,\nThese words did not as well appear,\n\"And so long after what happened here\n\"On the Twenty-second of July,\n\"Thirteen hundred and Seventy-six:\"\nAnd the better in memory to fix\nThe place of the Children's last retreat,\nThey called it, The Pied Piper's Street \u2014\nWhere any one playing on pipe or tabor\nWas sure for the future to lose his labour.\n\nNor suffered they Hostelry or Tavern\nTo shock with mirth a street so solemn;\nBut opposite the place of the cavern\nThey wrote the story on a column,\nAnd on the Great Church Window painted\nThe same, to make the world acquainted\nHow their children were stolen away;\nAnd there it stands to this very day.\n\nAnd I must not omit to say\nThat in Transylvania there's a tribe\nOf alien people who ascribe\nThe outlandish ways and dress\nOn which their neighbours lay such stress\nTo their fathers and mothers having risen\nOut of some subterraneous prison\nInto which they were trepanned\nLong time ago in a mighty band\nOut of Hamelin town in Brunswick land,\nBut how or why, they don't understand.\n\nSo, Willy, let you and me be wipers\nOf scores out with all men \u2014 especially pipers:\nAnd, whether they pipe us from rats or from mice,\nIf we've promised them aught, let us keep our promise.\n", "period": "Victorian", "literary_movement": "Romanticism", "register": "Narrative", "rhetorical_genre": "Epideictic", "discursive_structure": "Story", "discourse_type": "Third person", "narrative_level": "Extradiegetic", "diegetic_mimetic": "Mimetic", "focalization": "Omniscient", "person": "Third person", "deictic_orientation": "External", "addressee_type": "Implied", "deictic_object": "Hamelin", "temporal_orientation": "Past", "temporal_structure": "Linear", "tradition": "Oral tradition", "mode": "Narrative", "genre": "Fable", "stanza_structure": "Quatrains", "meter": "Iambic pentameter", "rhyme": "AABBCC"}

Go,\nAurora Leigh: be humble.\n\nThere it is,\nWe women are too apt to look to one,\nWhich proves a certain impotence in art.\n\nWe strain our natures at doing something great,\nFar less because it's something great to do,\nThan haply that we, so, commend ourselves\nAs being not small, and more appreciable\nTo some one friend.\n\nWe must have mediators\nBetwixt our highest conscience and the judge;\nSome sweet saint's blood must quicken in our palms,\nOr all the life in heaven seems slow and cold:\nGood only being perceived as the end of good,\nAnd God alone pleased,\u2014that's too poor, we think,\nAnd not enough for us by any means.\n\nAy\u2014Romney, I remember, told me once\nWe miss the abstract when we comprehend.\n\nWe miss it most when we aspire,\u2014and fail.\n\nYet, so, I will not.\n\n\u2014This vile woman's way\nOf trailing garments shall not trip me up:\nI'll have no traffic with the personal thought\nIn Art's pure temple.\n\nMust I work in vain,\nWithout the approbation of a man?\n\nIt cannot be; it shall not.\n\nFame itself,\nThat approbation of the general race,\nPresents a poor end (though the arrow speed\nShot straight with vigorous finger to the white),\nAnd the highest fame was never reached except\nBy what was aimed above it.\n\nArt for art,\nAnd good for God Himself, the essential Good!\nWe'll keep our aims sublime, our eyes erect,\nAlthough our woman-hands should shake and fail;\nAnd if we fail .\n\n\nBut must we?\n\nShall I fail?\n\nThe Greeks said grandly in their tragic phrase,\n\"Let no one be called happy till his death.\n\nTo which I add,\u2014Let no one till his death\nBe called unhappy.\n\nMeasure not the work\nUntil the day's out and the labour done,\nThen bring your gauges.\n\nIf the day's work's scant,\nWhy, call it scant; affect no compromise;\nAnd, in that we have nobly striven at least,\nDeal with us nobly, women though we be,\nAnd honour us with truth if not with praise.\n\nMy ballads prospered; but the ballad's race\nIs rapid for a poet who bears weights\nOf thought and golden image.\n\nHe can stand\nLike Atlas, in the sonnet,\u2014and support\nHis own heavens pregnant with dynastic stars;\nBut then he must stand still, nor take a step.\n\nIn that descriptive poem called \"The Hills,\"\nThe prospects were too far and indistinct.\n\n'Tis true my critics said \"A fine view, that!\"\nThe public scarcely cared to climb my book\nFor even the finest, and the public's right;\nA tree's mere firewood, unless humanised,\u2014\nWhich well the Greeks knew when they stirred its bark\nWith close-pressed bosoms of subsiding nymphs,\nAnd made the forest-rivers garrulous\nWith babble of gods.\n\nFor us, we are called to mark\nA still more intimate humanity\nIn this inferior nature, or ourselves\nMust fall like dead leaves trodden underfoot\nBy veritable artists.\n\nEarth (shut up\nBy Adam, like a fakir in a box\nLeft too long buried) remained stiff and dry,\nA mere dumb corpse, till Christ the Lord came down,\nUnlocked the doors, forced open the blank eyes,\nAnd used His kingly chrism to straighten out\nThe leathery tongue turned back into the throat;\nSince when, she lives, remembers, palpitates\nIn every limb, aspires in every breath,\nEmbraces infinite relations.\n\nNow\nWe want no half-gods, Panomph\u00e6an Joves,\nFauns, Naiads, Tritons, Oreads and the rest,\nTo take possession of a senseless world\nTo unnatural vampire-uses.\n\nSee the earth,\nThe body of our body, the green earth,\nIndubitably human like this flesh\nAnd these articulated veins through which\nOur heart drives blood.\n\nThere's not a flower of spring\nThat dies ere June but vaunts itself allied\nBy issue and symbol, by significance\nAnd correspondence, to that spirit-world\nOutside the limits of our space and time,\nWhereto we are bound.\n\nLet poets give it voice\nWith human meanings,\u2014else they miss the thought,\nAnd henceforth step down lower, stand confessed\nInstructed poorly for interpreters,\nThrown out by an easy cowslip in the text.\n\nEven so my pastoral failed: it was a book\nOf surface-pictures\u2014pretty, cold, and false\nWith literal transcript,\u2014the worse done, I think,\nFor being not ill-done: let me set my mark\nAgainst such doings, and do otherwise.\n\nThis strikes me.\n\n\u2014If the public whom we know\nCould catch me at such admissions, I should pass\nFor being right modest.\n\nYet how proud we are,\nIn daring to look down upon ourselves!\nThe critics say that epics have died out\nWith Agamemnon and the goat-nursed gods;\nI'll not believe it.\n\nI could never deem,\nAs Payne Knight did (the mythic mountaineer\nWho travelled higher than he was born to live,\nAnd showed sometimes the goitre in his throat\nDiscoursing of an image seen through fog),\nThat Homer's heroes measured twelve feet high.\n\nThey were but men:\u2014his Helen's hair turned grey\nLike any plain Miss Smith's who wears a front;\nAnd Hector's infant whimpered at a plume\nAs yours last Friday at a turkey-cock.\n\nAll actual heroes are essential men,\nAnd all men possible heroes: every age,\nHeroic in proportions, double-faced,\nLooks backward and before, expects a morn\nAnd claims an epos.\n\nAy, but every age\nAppears to souls who live in't (ask Carlyle)\nMost unheroic.\n\nOurs, for instance, ours:\nThe thinkers scout it, and the poets abound\nWho scorn to touch it with a finger-tip:\nA pewter age,\u2014mixed metal, silver-washed;\nAn age of scum, spooned off the richer past,\nAn age of patches for old gaberdines,\nAn age of mere transition, meaning nought\nExcept that what succeeds must shame it quite\nIf God please.\n\nThat's wrong thinking, to my mind,\nAnd wrong thoughts make poor poems.\n\nEvery age,\nThrough being beheld too close, is ill-discerned\nBy those who have not lived past it.\n\nWe'll suppose\nMount Athos carved, as Alexander schemed,\nTo some colossal statue of a man.\n\nThe peasants, gathering brushwood in his ear,\nHad guessed as little as the browsing goats\nOf form or feature of humanity\nUp there,\u2014in fact, had travelled five miles off\nOr ere the giant image broke on them,\nFull human profile, nose and chin distinct,\nMouth, muttering rhythms of silence up the sky\nAnd fed at evening with the blood of suns;\nGrand torso,\u2014hand, that flung perpetually\nThe largesse of a silver river down\nTo all the country pastures.\n\n'Tis even thus\nWith times we live in,\u2014evermore too great\nTo be apprehended near.\n\nBut poets should\nExert a double vision; should have eyes\nTo see near things as comprehensively\nAs if afar they took their point of sight,\nAnd distant things as intimately deep\nAs if they touched them.\n\nLet us strive for this.\n\nI do distrust the poet who discerns\nNo character or glory in his times,\nAnd trundles back his soul five hundred years,\nPast moat and drawbridge, into a castle-court,\nTo sing\u2014oh, not of lizard or of toad\nAlive i' the ditch there,\u2014'twere excusable,\nBut of some black chief, half knight, half sheep-lifter,\nSome beauteous dame, half chattel and half queen,\nAs dead as must be, for the greater part,\nThe poems made on their chivalric bones;\nAnd that's no wonder: death inherits death.\n\nNay, if there's room for poets in this world\nA little overgrown (I think there is),\nTheir sole work is to represent the age,\nTheir age, not Charlemagne's,\u2014this live, throbbing age,\nThat brawls, cheats, maddens, calculates, aspires,\nAnd spends more passion, more heroic heat,\nBetwixt the mirrors of its drawing-rooms,\nThan Roland with his knights at Roncesvalles.\n\nTo flinch from modern varnish, coat or flounce,\nCry out for togas and the picturesque,\nIs fatal,\u2014foolish too.\n\nKing Arthur's self\nWas commonplace to Lady Guenever;\nAnd Camelot to minstrels seemed as flat\nAs Fleet Street to our poets.\n\nNever flinch,\nBut still, unscrupulously epic, catch\nUpon the burning lava of a song\nThe full-veined, heaving, double-breasted Age:\nThat, when the next shall come, the men of that\nMay touch the impress with reverent hand, and say\n\"Behold,\u2014behold the paps we all have sucked!\nThis bosom seems to beat still, or at least\nIt sets ours beating: this is living art,\nWhich thus presents and thus records true life.\n\nWhat form is best for poems?\n\nLet me think\nOf forms less, and the external.\n\nTrust the spirit,\nAs sovran nature does, to make the form;\nFor otherwise we only imprison spirit\nAnd not embody.\n\nInward evermore\nTo outward,\u2014so in life, and so in art\nWhich still is life.\n\nFive acts to make a play.\n\nAnd why not fifteen?\n\nwhy not ten?\n\nor seven?\n\nWhat matter for the number of the leaves,\nSupposing the tree lives and grows?\n\nexact\nThe literal unities of time and place,\nWhen 'tis the essence of passion to ignore\nBoth time and place?\n\nAbsurd.\n\nKeep up the fire,\nAnd leave the generous flames to shape themselves.\n\n'Tis true the stage requires obsequiousness\nTo this or that convention; \"exit\" here\nAnd \"enter\" there; the points for clapping, fixed,\nLike Jacob's white-peeled rods before the rams,\nAnd all the close-curled imagery clipped\nIn manner of their fleece at shearing-time.\n\nForget to prick the galleries to the heart\nPrecisely at the fourth act,\u2014culminate\nOur five pyramidal acts with one act more,\u2014\nWe're lost so: Shakespeare's ghost could scarcely plead\nAgainst our just damnation.\n\nStand aside;\nWe'll muse for comfort that, last century,\nOn this same tragic stage on which we have failed,\nA wigless Hamlet would have failed the same.\n\nAnd whosoever writes good poetry,\nLooks just to art.\n\nHe does not write for you\nOr me,\u2014for London or for Edinburgh;\nHe will not suffer the best critic known\nTo step into his sunshine of free thought\nAnd self-absorbed conception and exact\nAn inch-long swerving of the holy lines.\n\nIf virtue done for popularity\nDefiles like vice, can art, for praise or hire,\nStill keep its splendour and remain pure art?\n\nEschew such serfdom.\n\nWhat the poet writes,\nHe writes: mankind accepts it if it suits,\nAnd that's success: if not, the poem's passed\nFrom hand to hand, and yet from hand to hand\nUntil the unborn snatch it, crying out\nIn pity on their fathers' being so dull,\nAnd that's success too.\n\nI will write no plays;\nBecause the drama, less sublime in this,\nMakes lower appeals, submits more menially,\nAdopts the standard of the public taste\nTo chalk its height on, wears a dog-chain round\nIts regal neck, and learns to carry and fetch\nThe fashions of the day to please the day,\nFawns close on pit and boxes, who clap hands\nCommending chiefly its docility\nAnd humour in stage-tricks,\u2014or else indeed\nGets hissed at, howled at, stamped at like a dog,\nOr worse, we'll say.\n\nFor dogs, unjustly kicked,\nYell, bite at need; but if your dramatist\n(Being wronged by some five hundred nobodies\nBecause their grosser brains most naturally\nMisjudge the fineness of his subtle wit)\nShows teeth an almond's breadth, protests the length\nOf a modest phrase,\u2014\"My gentle countrymen,\n\"There's something in it haply of your fault,\"\u2014\nWhy then, besides five hundred nobodies,\nHe'll have five thousand and five thousand more\nAgainst him,\u2014the whole public,\u2014all the hoofs\nOf King Saul's father's asses, in full drove,\nAnd obviously deserve it.\n\nHe appealed\nTo these,\u2014and why say more if they condemn,\nThan if they praise him?\n\n\u2014Weep, my \u00c6schylus,\nBut low and far, upon Sicilian shores!\nFor since 'twas Athens (so I read the myth)\nWho gave commission to that fatal weight\nThe tortoise, cold and hard, to drop on thee\nAnd crush thee,\u2014better cover thy bald head;\nShe'll hear the softest hum of Hyblan bee\nBefore thy loudest protestation!\nThen\nThe risk's still worse upon the modern stage.\n\nI could not, for so little, accept success,\nNor would I risk so much, in ease and calm,\nFor manifester gains: let those who prize,\nPursue them: I stand off.\n\nAnd yet, forbid\nThat any irreverent fancy or conceit\nShould litter in the Drama's throne-room where\nThe rulers of our art, in whose full veins\nDynastic glories mingle, sit in strength\nAnd do their kingly work,\u2014conceive, command,\nAnd, from the imagination's crucial heat,\nCatch up their men and women all a-flame\nFor action, all alive and forced to prove\nTheir life by living out heart, brain, and nerve,\nUntil mankind makes witness, \"These be men\nAs we are,\" and vouchsafes the greeting due\nTo Imogen and Juliet\u2014sweetest kin\nOn art's side.\n\n'Tis that, honouring to its worth\nThe drama, I would fear to keep it down\nTo the level of the footlights.\n\nDies no more\nThe sacrificial goat, for Bacchus slain,\nHis filmed eyes fluttered by the whirling white\nOf choral vestures,\u2014troubled in his blood,\nWhile tragic voices that clanged keen as swords,\nLeapt high together with the altar-flame\nAnd made the blue air wink.\n\nThe waxen mask,\nWhich set the grand still front of Themis' son\nUpon the puckered visage of a player,\u2014\nThe buskin, which he rose upon and moved,\nAs some tall ship first conscious of the wind\nSweeps slowly past the piers,\u2014the mouthpiece, where\nThe mere man's voice with all its breaths and breaks\nWent sheathed in brass, and clashed on even heights\nIts phras\u00e8d thunders,\u2014these things are no more,\nWhich once were.\n\nAnd concluding, which is clear,\nThe growing drama has outgrown such toys\nOf simulated stature, face, and speech,\nIt also peradventure may outgrow\nThe simulation of the painted scene,\nBoards, actors, prompters, gaslight, and costume,\nAnd take for a worthier stage the soul itself,\nIts shifting fancies and celestial lights,\nWith all its grand orchestral silences\nTo keep the pauses of its rhythmic sounds.\n\nAlas, I still see something to be done,\nAnd what I do falls short of what I see,\nThough I waste myself on doing.\n\nLong green days,\nWorn bare of grass and sunshine,\u2014long calm nights\nFrom which the silken sleeps were fretted out,\nBe witness for me, with no amateur's\nIrreverent haste and busy idleness\nI set myself to art! What then?\n\nwhat's done?\n\nWhat's done, at last?\n\nBehold, at last, a book.\n\nIf life-blood's necessary, which it is,\u2014\n(By that blue vein athrob on Mahomet's brow,\nEach prophet-poet's book must show man's blood!)\nIf life-blood's fertilising, I wrung mine\nOn every leaf of this,\u2014unless the drops\nSlid heavily on one side and left it dry.\n\nThat chances often: many a fervid man\nWrites books as cold and flat as graveyard stones\nFrom which the lichen's scraped; and if Saint Preux\nHad written his own letters, as he might,\nWe had never wept to think of the little mole\n'Neath Julie's drooping eyelid.\n\nPassion is\nBut something suffered, after all.\n\nWhile Art\nSets action on the top of suffering:\nThe artist's part is both to be and do,\nTransfixing with a special, central power\nThe flat experience of the common man,\nAnd turning outward, with a sudden wrench,\nHalf agony, half ecstasy, the thing\nHe feels the inmost,\u2014never felt the less\nBecause he sings it.\n\nDoes a torch less burn\nFor burning next reflectors of blue steel,\nThat he should be the colder for his place\n'Twixt two incessant fires,\u2014his personal life's\nAnd that intense refraction which burns back\nPerpetually against him from the round\nOf crystal conscience he was born into\nIf artist-born?\n\nO sorrowful great gift\nConferred on poets, of a twofold life,\nWhen one life has been found enough for pain!\nWe, staggering 'neath our burden as mere men,\nBeing called to stand up straight as demigods,\nSupport the intolerable strain and stress\nOf the universal, and send clearly up,\nWith voices broken by the human sob,\nOur poems to find rhymes among the stars!\nBut soft,\u2014a \"poet\" is a word soon said,\nA book's a thing soon written.\n\nNay, indeed,\nThe more the poet shall be questionable,\nThe more unquestionably comes his book.\n\nAnd this of mine\u2014well, granting to myself\nSome passion in it,\u2014furrowing up the flats,\nMere passion will not prove a volume worth\nIts gall and rags even.\n\nBubbles round a keel\nMean nought, excepting that the vessel moves.\n\nThere's more than passion goes to make a man\nOr book, which is a man too.\n\nI am sad.\n\nI wonder if Pygmalion had these doubts\nAnd, feeling the hard marble first relent,\nGrow supple to the straining of his arms,\nAnd tingle through its cold to his burning lip,\nSupposed his senses mocked, supposed the toil\nOf stretching past the known and seen to reach\nThe archetypal Beauty out of sight,\nHad made his heart beat fast enough for two,\nAnd with his own life dazed and blinded him!\nNot so; Pygmalion loved,\u2014and whoso loves\nBelieves the impossible.\n\nBut I am sad:\nI cannot thoroughly love a work of mine,\nSince none seems worthy of my thought and hope\nMore highly mated.\n\nHe has shot them down,\nMy Phoebus Apollo, soul within my soul,\nWho judges, by the attempted, what's attained,\nAnd with the silver arrow from his height\nHas struck down all my works before my face\nWhile I said nothing.\n\nIs there aught to say?\n\nI called the artist but a greatened man.\n\nHe may be childless also, like a man.\n\nI laboured on alone.\n\nThe wind and dust\nAnd sun of the world beat blistering in my face;\nAnd hope, now for me, now against me, dragged\nMy spirits onward, as some fallen balloon,\nWhich, whether caught by blossoming tree or bare,\nIs torn alike.\n\nI sometimes touched my aim,\nOr seemed,\u2014and generous souls cried out \"Be strong,\nTake courage; now you're on our level,\u2014now!\nThe next step saves you!\" I was flushed with praise,\nBut, pausing just a moment to draw breath,\nI could not choose but murmur to myself\n\"Is this all?\n\nall that's done?\n\nand all that's gained?\n\nIf this then be success, 'tis dismaller\nThan any failure.\n\nO my God, my God,\nO supreme Artist, who as sole return\nFor all the cosmic wonder of Thy work,\nDemandest of us just a word .\n\n\na name,\n\"My Father!\" thou hast knowledge, only thou,\nHow dreary 'tis for women to sit still,\nOn winter nights by solitary fires,\nAnd hear the nations praising them far off,\nToo far!

have written much in prose and verse\nFor others' uses, will write now for mine,\u2014\nWill write my story for my better self,\nAs when you paint your portrait for a friend,\nWho keeps it in a drawer and looks at it\nLong after he has ceased to love you, just\nTo hold together what he was and is.\n\nI, writing thus, am still what men call young;\nI have not so far left the coasts of life\nTo travel inland, that I cannot hear\nThat murmur of the outer Infinite\nWhich unweaned babies smile at in their sleep\nWhen wondered at for smiling; not so far,\nBut still I catch my mother at her post\nBeside the nursery door, with finger up,\n\"Hush, hush\u2014here's too much noise!\" while her sweet eyes\nLeap forward, taking part against her word\nIn the child's riot.\n\nStill I sit and feel\nMy father's slow hand, when she had left us both,\nStroke out my childish curls across his knee,\nAnd hear Assunta's daily jest (she knew\nHe liked it better than a better jest)\nInquire how many golden scudi went\nTo make such ringlets.\n\nO my father's hand,\nStroke heavily, heavily the poor hair down,\nDraw, press the child's head closer to thy knee!\nI'm still too young, too young, to sit alone.\n\nI write.\n\nMy mother was a Florentine,\nWhose rare blue eyes were shut from seeing me\nWhen scarcely I was four years old, my life\nA poor spark snatched up from a failing lamp\nWhich went out therefore.\n\nShe was weak and frail;\nShe could not bear the joy of giving life,\nThe mother's rapture slew her.\n\nIf her kiss\nHad left a longer weight upon my lips\nIt might have steadied the uneasy breath,\nAnd reconciled and fraternised my soul\nWith the new order.\n\nAs it was, indeed,\nI felt a mother-want about the world,\nAnd still went seeking, like a bleating lamb\nLeft out at night in shutting up the fold,\u2014\nAs restless as a nest-deserted bird\nGrown chill through something being away, though what\nIt knows not.\n\nI, Aurora Leigh, was born\nTo make my father sadder, and myself\nNot overjoyous, truly.\n\nWomen know\nThe way to rear up children (to be just),\nThey know a simple, merry, tender knack\nOf tying sashes, fitting baby-shoes,\nAnd stringing pretty words that make no sense,\nAnd kissing full sense into empty words,\nWhich things are corals to cut life upon,\nAlthough such trifles: children learn by such,\nLove's holy earnest in a pretty play\nAnd get not over-early solemnised,\nBut seeing, as in a rose-bush, Love's Divine\nWhich burns and hurts not,\u2014not a single bloom,\u2014\nBecome aware and unafraid of Love.\n\nSuch good do mothers.\n\nFathers love as well\n\u2014Mine did, I know,\u2014but still with heavier brains,\nAnd wills more consciously responsible,\nAnd not as wisely, since less foolishly;\nSo mothers have God's license to be missed.\n\nMy father was an austere Englishman,\nWho, after a dry lifetime spent at home\nIn college-learning, law, and parish talk,\nWas flooded with a passion unaware,\nHis whole provisioned and complacent past\nDrowned out from him that moment.\n\nAs he stood\nIn Florence, where he had come to spend a month\nAnd note the secret of Da Vinci's drains,\nHe musing somewhat absently perhaps\nSome English question .\n\n\nwhether men should pay\nThe unpopular but necessary tax\nWith left or right hand\u2014in the alien sun\nIn that great square of the Santissima\nThere drifted past him (scarcely marked enough\nTo move his comfortable island scorn)\nA train of priestly banners, cross and psalm,\nThe white-veiled rose-crowned maidens holding up\nTall tapers, weighty for such wrists, aslant\nTo the blue luminous tremor of the air,\nAnd letting drop the white wax as they went\nTo eat the bishop's wafer at the church;\nFrom which long trail of chanting priests and girls,\nA face flashed like a cymbal on his face\nAnd shook with silent clangour brain and heart,\nTransfiguring him to music.\n\nThus, even thus,\nHe too received his sacramental gift\nWith eucharistic meanings; for he loved.\n\nAnd thus beloved, she died.\n\nI've heard it said\nThat but to see him in the first surprise\nOf widower and father, nursing me,\nUnmothered little child of four years old,\nHis large man's hands afraid to touch my curls,\nAs if the gold would tarnish,\u2014his grave lips\nContriving such a miserable smile\nAs if he knew needs must, or I should die,\nAnd yet 'twas hard,\u2014would almost make the stones\nCry out for pity.\n\nThere's a verse he set\nIn Santa Croce to her memory,\u2014\n\"Weep for an infant too young to weep much\nWhen death removed this mother\"\u2014stops the mirth\nTo-day on women's faces when they walk\nWith rosy children hanging on their gowns,\nUnder the cloister to escape the sun\nThat scorches in the piazza.\n\nAfter which\nHe left our Florence and made haste to hide\nHimself, his prattling child, and silent grief,\nAmong the mountains above Pelago;\nBecause unmothered babes, he thought, had need\nOf mother nature more than others use,\nAnd Pan's white goats, with udders warm and full\nOf mystic contemplations, come to feed\nPoor milkless lips of orphans like his own\u2014\nSuch scholar-scraps he talked, I've heard from friends,\nFor even prosaic men who wear grief long\nWill get to wear it as a hat aside\nWith a flower stuck in't.\n\nFather, then, and child,\nWe lived among the mountains many years,\nGod's silence on the outside of the house,\nAnd we who did not speak too loud within,\nAnd old Assunta to make up the fire,\nCrossing herself whene'er a sudden flame\nWhich lightened from the firewood, made alive\nThat picture of my mother on the wall.\n\nThe painter drew it after she was dead,\nAnd when the face was finished, throat and hands,\nHer cameriera carried him, in hate\nOf the English-fashioned shroud, the last brocade\nShe dressed in at the Pitti; \"he should paint\nNo sadder thing than that,\" she swore, \"to wrong\nHer poor signora.\n\n\" Therefore very strange\nThe effect was.\n\nI, a little child, would crouch\nFor hours upon the floor with knees drawn up,\nAnd gaze across them, half in terror, half\nIn adoration, at the picture there,\u2014\nThat swan-like supernatural white life\nJust sailing upward from the red stiff silk\nWhich seemed to have no part in it nor power\nTo keep it from quite breaking out of bounds.\n\nFor hours I sat and stared.\n\nAssunta's awe\nAnd my poor father's melancholy eyes\nStill pointed that way.\n\nThat way went my thoughts\nWhen wandering beyond sight.\n\nAnd as I grew\nIn years, I mixed, confused, unconsciously,\nWhatever I last read or heard or dreamed,\nAbhorrent, admirable, beautiful,\nPathetical, or ghastly, or grotesque,\nWith still that face .\n\n\nwhich did not therefore change,\nBut kept the mystic level of all forms,\nHates, fears, and admirations, was by turns\nGhost, fiend, and angel, fairy, witch, and sprite,\nA dauntless Muse who eyes a dreadful Fate,\nA loving Psyche who loses sight of Love,\nA still Medusa with mild milky brows\nAll curdled and all clothed upon with snakes\nWhose slime falls fast as sweat will; or anon\nOur Lady of the Passion, stabbed with swords\nWhere the Babe sucked; or Lamia in her first\nMoonlighted pallor, ere she shrunk and blinked\nAnd shuddering wriggled down to the unclean;\nOr my own mother, leaving her last smile\nIn her last kiss upon the baby-mouth\nMy father pushed down on the bed for that,\u2014\nOr my dead mother, without smile or kiss,\nBuried at Florence.\n\nAll which images,\nConcentred on the picture, glassed themselves\nBefore my meditative childhood, as\nThe incoherencies of change and death\nAre represented fully, mixed and merged,\nIn the smooth fair mystery of perpetual Life.\n\nAnd while I stared away my childish wits\nUpon my mother's picture (ah, poor child!),\nMy father, who through love had suddenly\nThrown off the old conventions, broken loose\nFrom chin-bands of the soul, like Lazarus,\nYet had no time to learn to talk and walk\nOr grow anew familiar with the sun,\u2014\nWho had reached to freedom, not to action, lived,\nBut lived as one entranced, with thoughts, not aims,\u2014\nWhom love had unmade from a common man\nBut not completed to an uncommon man,\u2014\nMy father taught me what he had learnt the best\nBefore he died and left me,\u2014grief and love.\n\nAnd, seeing we had books among the hills,\nStrong words of counselling souls confederate\nWith vocal pines and waters,\u2014out of books\nHe taught me all the ignorance of men,\nAnd how God laughs in heaven when any man\nSays \"Here I'm learned; this, I understand;\nIn that, I am never caught at fault or doubt.\n\nHe sent the schools to school, demonstrating\nA fool will pass for such through one mistake,\nWhile a philosopher will pass for such,\nThrough said mistakes being ventured in the gross\nAnd heaped up to a system.\n\nI am like,\nThey tell me, my dear father.\n\nBroader brows\nHowbeit, upon a slenderer undergrowth\nOf delicate features,\u2014paler, near as grave;\nBut then my mother's smile breaks up the whole,\nAnd makes it better sometimes than itself.\n\nSo, nine full years, our days were hid with God\nAmong his mountains: I was just thirteen,\nStill growing like the plants from unseen roots\nIn tongue-tied Springs,\u2014and suddenly awoke\nTo full life and life's needs and agonies\nWith an intense, strong, struggling heart beside\nA stone-dead father.\n\nLife, struck sharp on death,\nMakes awful lightning.\n\nHis last word was \"Love\u2014\"\n\"Love, my child, love, love!\"\u2014(then he had done with grief)\n\"Love, my child.\n\n\" Ere I answered he was gone,\nAnd none was left to love in all the world.\n\nThere, ended childhood.\n\nWhat succeeded next\nI recollect as, after fevers, men\nThread back the passage of delirium,\nMissing the turn still, baffled by the door;\nSmooth endless days, notched here and there with knives,\nA weary, wormy darkness, spurred i' the flank\nWith flame, that it should eat and end itself\nLike some tormented scorpion.\n\nThen at last\nI do remember clearly how there came\nA stranger with authority, not right\n(I thought not), who commanded, caught me up\nFrom old Assunta's neck; how, with a shriek,\nShe let me go,\u2014while I, with ears too full\nOf my father's silence to shriek back a word,\nIn all a child's astonishment at grief\nStared at the wharf-edge where she stood and moaned,\nMy poor Assunta, where she stood and moaned!\nThe white walls, the blue hills, my Italy,\nDrawn backward from the shuddering steamer-deck,\nLike one in anger drawing back her skirts\nWhich suppliants catch at.\n\nThen the bitter sea\nInexorably pushed between us both\nAnd, sweeping up the ship with my despair,\nThrew us out as a pasture to the stars.\n\nTen nights and days we voyaged on the deep;\nTen nights and days without the common face\nOf any day or night; the moon and sun\nCut off from the green reconciling earth,\nTo starve into a blind ferocity\nAnd glare unnatural; the very sky\n(Dropping its bell-net down upon the sea,\nAs if no human heart should 'scape alive)\nBedraggled with the desolating salt,\nUntil it seemed no more that holy heaven\nTo which my father went.\n\nAll new and strange;\nThe universe turned stranger, for a child.\n\nThen, land!\u2014then, England! oh, the frosty cliffs\nLooked cold upon me.\n\nCould I find a home\nAmong those mean red houses through the fog?\n\nAnd when I heard my father's language first\nFrom alien lips which had no kiss for mine\nI wept aloud, then laughed, then wept, then wept,\nAnd some one near me said the child was mad\nThrough much sea-sickness.\n\nThe train swept us on:\nWas this my father's England?\n\nthe great isle?\n\nThe ground seemed cut up from the fellowship\nOf verdure, field from field, as man from man;\nThe skies themselves looked low and positive,\nAs almost you could touch them with a hand,\nAnd dared to do it they were so far off\nFrom God's celestial crystals; all things blurred\nAnd dull and vague.\n\nDid Shakespeare and his mates\nAbsorb the light here?\n\n\u2014not a hill or stone\nWith heart to strike a radiant colour up\nOr active outline on the indifferent air.\n\nI think I see my father's sister stand\nUpon the hall-step of her country-house\nTo give me welcome.\n\nShe stood straight and calm,\nHer somewhat narrow forehead braided tight\nAs if for taming accidental thoughts\nFrom possible pulses; brown hair pricked with gray\nBy frigid use of life (she was not old,\nAlthough my father's elder by a year),\nA nose drawn sharply, yet in delicate lines;\nA close mild mouth, a little soured about\nThe ends, through speaking unrequited loves\nOr peradventure niggardly half-truths;\nEyes of no colour,\u2014once they might have smiled,\nBut never, never have forgot themselves\nIn smiling; cheeks, in which was yet a rose\nOf perished summers, like a rose in a book,\nKept more for ruth than pleasure,\u2014if past bloom,\nPast fading also.\n\nShe had lived, we'll say,\nA harmless life, she called a virtuous life,\nA quiet life, which was not life at all\n(But that, she had not lived enough to know),\nBetween the vicar and the county squires,\nThe lord-lieutenant looking down sometimes\nFrom the empyrean to assure their souls\nAgainst chance vulgarisms, and, in the abyss,\nThe apothecary, looked on once a year\nTo prove their soundness of humility.\n\nThe poor-club exercised her Christian gifts\nOf knitting stockings, stitching petticoats,\nBecause we are of one flesh, after all,\nAnd need one flannel (with a proper sense\nOf difference in the quality)\u2014and still\nThe book-club, guarded from your modern trick\nOf shaking dangerous questions from the crease,\nPreserved her intellectual.\n\nShe had lived\nA sort of cage-bird life, born in a cage,\nAccounting that to leap from perch to perch\nWas act and joy enough for any bird.\n\nDear heaven, how silly are the things that live\nIn thickets, and eat berries!\nI, alas,\nA wild bird scarcely fledged, was brought to her cage,\nAnd she was there to meet me.\n\nVery kind.\n\nBring the clean water, give out the fresh seed.\n\nShe stood upon the steps to welcome me,\nCalm, in black garb.\n\nI clung about her neck,\u2014\nYoung babes, who catch at every shred of wool\nTo draw the new light closer, catch and cling\nLess blindly.\n\nIn my ears my father's word\nHummed ignorantly, as the sea in shells,\n\"Love, love, my child.\n\n\" She, black there with my grief,\nMight feel my love\u2014she was his sister once\u2014\nI clung to her.\n\nA moment she seemed moved,\nKissed me with cold lips, suffered me to cling,\nAnd drew me feebly through the hall into\nThe room she sat in.\n\nThere, with some strange spasm\nOf pain and passion, she wrung loose my hands\nImperiously, and held me at arm's length,\nAnd with two grey-steel naked-bladed eyes\nSearched through my face,\u2014ay, stabbed it through and through,\nThrough brows and cheeks and chin, as if to find\nA wicked murderer in my innocent face,\nIf not here, there perhaps.\n\nThen, drawing breath,\nShe struggled for her ordinary calm\u2014\nAnd missed it rather,\u2014told me not to shrink,\nAs if she had told me not to lie or swear,\u2014\n\"She loved my father and would love me too\nAs long as I deserved it.\n\n\" Very kind.\n\nI understood her meaning afterward;\nShe thought to find my mother in my face,\nAnd questioned it for that.\n\nFor she, my aunt,\nHad loved my father truly, as she could,\nAnd hated, with the gall of gentle souls,\nMy Tuscan mother who had fooled away\nA wise man from wise courses, a good man\nFrom obvious duties, and, depriving her,\nHis sister, of the household precedence,\nHad wronged his tenants, robbed his native land,\nAnd made him mad, alike by life and death,\nIn love and sorrow.\n\nShe had pored for years\nWhat sort of woman could be suitable\nTo her sort of hate, to entertain it with,\nAnd so, her very curiosity\nBecame hate too, and all the idealism\nShe ever used in life was used for hate,\nTill hate, so nourished, did exceed at last\nThe love from which it grew, in strength and heat,\nAnd wrinkled her smooth conscience with a sense\nOf disputable virtue (say not, sin)\nWhen Christian doctrine was enforced at church.\n\nAnd thus my father's sister was to me\nMy mother's hater.\n\nFrom that day she did\nHer duty to me (I appreciate it\nIn her own word as spoken to herself),\nHer duty, in large measure, well pressed out,\nBut measured always.\n\nShe was generous, bland,\nMore courteous than was tender, gave me still\nThe first place,\u2014as if fearful that God's saints\nWould look down suddenly and say \"Herein\nYou missed a point, I think, through lack of love.\n\nAlas, a mother never is afraid\nOf speaking angerly to any child,\nSince love, she knows, is justified of love.\n\nAnd I, I was a good child on the whole,\nA meek and manageable child.\n\nWhy not?\n\nI did not live, to have the faults of life:\nThere seemed more true life in my father's grave\nThan in all England.\n\nSince that threw me off\nWho fain would cleave (his latest will, they say,\nConsigned me to his land), I only thought\nOf lying quiet there where I was thrown\nLike sea-weed on the rocks, and suffering her\nTo prick me to a pattern with her pin,\nFibre from fibre, delicate leaf from leaf,\nAnd dry out from my drowned anatomy\nThe last sea-salt left in me.\n\nSo it was.\n\nI broke the copious curls upon my head\nIn braids, because she liked smooth-ordered hair.\n\nI left off saying my sweet Tuscan words\nWhich still at any stirring of the heart\nCame up to float across the English phrase\nAs lilies (Bene or Che che), because\nShe liked my father's child to speak his tongue.\n\nI learnt the collects and the catechism,\nThe creeds, from Athanasius back to Nice,\nThe Articles, the Tracts against the times\n(By no means Buonaventure's \"Prick of Love\"),\nAnd various popular synopses of\nInhuman doctrines never taught by John,\nBecause she liked instructed piety.\n\nI learnt my complement of classic French\n(Kept pure of Balzac and neologism)\nAnd German also, since she liked a range\nOf liberal education,\u2014tongues, not books.\n\nI learnt a little algebra, a little\nOf the mathematics,\u2014brushed with extreme flounce\nThe circle of the sciences, because\nShe misliked women who are frivolous.\n\nI learnt the royal genealogies\nOf Oviedo, the internal laws\nOf the Burmese empire,\u2014by how many feet\nMount Chimborazo outsoars Teneriffe,\nWhat navigable river joins itself\nTo Lara, and what census of the year five\nWas taken at Klagenfurt,\u2014because she liked\nA general insight into useful facts.\n\nI learnt much music,\u2014such as would have been\nAs quite impossible in Johnson's day\nAs still it might be wished\u2014fine sleights of hand\nAnd unimagined fingering, shuffling off\nThe hearer's soul through hurricanes of notes\nTo a noisy Tophet; and I drew .\n\n\ncostumes\nFrom French engravings, nereids neatly draped\n(With smirks of simmering godship): I washed in\nLandscapes from nature (rather say, washed out).\n\nI danced the polka and Cellarius,\nSpun glass, stuffed birds, and modelled flowers in wax,\nBecause she liked accomplishments in girls.\n\nI read a score of books on womanhood\nTo prove, if women do not think at all,\nThey may teach thinking (to a maiden aunt\nOr else the author),\u2014books that boldly assert\nTheir right of comprehending husband's talk\nWhen not too deep, and even of answering\nWith pretty \"may it please you,\" or \"so it is,\"\u2014\nTheir rapid insight and fine aptitude,\nParticular worth and general missionariness,\nAs long as they keep quiet by the fire\nAnd never say \"no\" when the world says \"ay,\"\nFor that is fatal,\u2014their angelic reach\nOf virtue, chiefly used to sit and darn,\nAnd fatten household sinners,\u2014their, in brief,\nPotential faculty in everything\nOf abdicating power in it: she owned\nShe liked a woman to be womanly,\nAnd English women, she thanked God and sighed\n(Some people always sigh in thanking God),\nWere models to the universe.\n\nAnd last\nI learnt cross-stitch, because she did not like\nTo see me wear the night with empty hands\nA-doing nothing.\n\nSo, my shepherdess\nWas something after all (the pastoral saints\nBe praised for't), leaning lovelorn with pink eyes\nTo match her shoes, when I mistook the silks;\nHer head uncrushed by that round weight of hat\nSo strangely similar to the tortoise-shell\nWhich slew the tragic poet.\n\nBy the way,\nThe works of women are symbolical.\n\nWe sew, sew, prick our fingers, dull our sight,\nProducing what?\n\nA pair of slippers, sir,\nTo put on when you're weary\u2014or a stool\nTo stumble over and vex you .\n\n\n\"curse that stool!\"\nOr else at best, a cushion, where you lean\nAnd sleep, and dream of something we are not\nBut would be for your sake.\n\nAlas, alas!\nThis hurts most, this\u2014that, after all, we are paid\nThe worth of our work, perhaps.\n\nIn looking down\nThose years of education (to return)\nI wonder if Brinvilliers suffered more\nIn the water-torture .\n\n\nflood succeeding flood\nTo drench the incapable throat and split the veins .\n\n\nThan I did.\n\nCertain of your feebler souls\nGo out in such a process; many pine\nTo a sick, inodorous light; my own endured:\nI had relations in the Unseen, and drew\nThe elemental nutriment and heat\nFrom nature, as earth feels the sun at nights,\nOr as a babe sucks surely in the dark.\n\nI kept the life thrust on me, on the outside\nOf the inner life with all its ample room\nFor heart and lungs, for will and intellect,\nInviolable by conventions.\n\nGod,\nI thank thee for that grace of thine!\nAt first\nI felt no life which was not patience,\u2014did\nThe thing she bade me, without heed to a thing\nBeyond it, sat in just the chair she placed,\nWith back against the window, to exclude\nThe sight of the great lime-tree on the lawn,\nWhich seemed to have come on purpose from the woods\nTo bring the house a message,\u2014ay, and walked\nDemurely in her carpeted low rooms,\nAs if I should not, hearkening my own steps,\nMisdoubt I was alive.\n\nI read her books,\nWas civil to her cousin, Romney Leigh,\nGave ear to her vicar, tea to her visitors,\nAnd heard them whisper, when I changed a cup\n(I blushed for joy at that),\u2014\"The Italian child,\nFor all her blue eyes and her quiet ways,\nThrives ill in England: she is paler yet\nThan when we came the last time; she will die.\n\n\"Will die.\n\n\" My cousin, Romney Leigh, blushed too,\nWith sudden anger, and approaching me\nSaid low between his teeth, \"You're wicked now?\n\nYou wish to die and leave the world a-dusk\nFor others, with your naughty light blown out?\n\nI looked into his face defyingly;\nHe might have known that, being what I was,\n'Twas natural to like to get away\nAs far as dead folk can: and then indeed\nSome people make no trouble when they die.\n\nHe turned and went abruptly, slammed the door,\nAnd shut his dog out.\n\nRomney, Romney Leigh.\n\nI have not named my cousin hitherto,\nAnd yet I used him as a sort of friend;\nMy elder by few years, but cold and shy\nAnd absent .\n\n\ntender, when he thought of it,\nWhich scarcely was imperative, grave betimes,\nAs well as early master of Leigh Hall,\nWhereof the nightmare sat upon his youth,\nRepressing all its seasonable delights,\nAnd agonising with a ghastly sense\nOf universal hideous want and wrong\nTo incriminate possession.\n\nWhen he came\nFrom college to the country, very oft\nHe crossed the hill on visits to my aunt,\nWith gifts of blue grapes from the hothouses,\nA book in one hand,\u2014mere statistics (if\nI chanced to lift the cover), count of all\nThe goats whose beards grow sprouting down toward hell\nAgainst God's separative judgment-hour.\n\nAnd she, she almost loved him,\u2014even allowed\nThat sometimes he should seem to sigh my way;\nIt made him easier to be pitiful,\nAnd sighing was his gift.\n\nSo, undisturbed,\nAt whiles she let him shut my music up\nAnd push my needles down, and lead me out\nTo see in that south angle of the house\nThe figs grow black as if by a Tuscan rock,\nOn some light pretext.\n\nShe would turn her head\nAt other moments, go to fetch a thing,\nAnd leave me breath enough to speak with him,\nFor his sake; it was simple.\n\nSometimes too\nHe would have saved me utterly, it seemed,\nHe stood and looked so.\n\nOnce, he stood so near,\nHe dropped a sudden hand upon my head\nBent down on woman's work, as soft as rain\u2014\nBut then I rose and shook it off as fire,\nThe stranger's touch that took my father's place\nYet dared seem soft.\n\nI used him for a friend\nBefore I ever knew him for a friend.\n\n'Twas better, 'twas worse also, afterward:\nWe came so close, we saw our differences\nToo intimately.\n\nAlways Romney Leigh\nWas looking for the worms, I for the gods.\n\nA godlike nature his; the gods look down,\nIncurious of themselves; and certainly\n'Tis well I should remember, how, those days,\nI was a worm too, and he looked on me.\n\nA little by his act perhaps, yet more\nBy something in me, surely not my will,\nI did not die.\n\nBut slowly, as one in swoon,\nTo whom life creeps back in the form of death,\nWith a sense of separation, a blind pain\nOf blank obstruction, and a roar i' the ears\nOf visionary chariots which retreat\nAs earth grows clearer .\n\n\nslowly, by degrees,\nI woke, rose up .\n\n\nwhere was I?\n\nin the world;\nFor uses therefore I must count worth while.\n\nI had a little chamber in the house,\nAs green as any privet-hedge a bird\nMight choose to build in, though the nest itself\nCould show but dead-brown sticks and straws; the walls\nWere green, the carpet was pure green, the straight\nSmall bed was curtained greenly, and the folds\nHung green about the window which let in\nThe out-door world with all its greenery.\n\nYou could not push your head out and escape\nA dash of dawn-dew from the honeysuckle,\nBut so you were baptized into the grace\nAnd privilege of seeing.\n\n\nFirst, the lime\n(I had enough there, of the lime, be sure,\u2014\nMy morning-dream was often hummed away\nBy the bees in it); past the lime, the lawn,\nWhich, after sweeping broadly round the house,\nWent trickling through the shrubberies in a stream\nOf tender turf, and wore and lost itself\nAmong the acacias, over which you saw\nThe irregular line of elms by the deep lane\nWhich stopped the grounds and dammed the overflow\nOf arbutus and laurel.\n\nOut of sight\nThe lane was; sunk so deep, no foreign tramp\nNor drover of wild ponies out of Wales\nCould guess if lady's hall or tenant's lodge\nDispensed such odours,\u2014though his stick well-crooked\nMight reach the lowest trail of blossoming briar\nWhich dipped upon the wall.\n\nBehind the elms,\nAnd through their tops, you saw the folded hills\nStriped up and down with hedges (burly oaks\nProjecting from the line to show themselves),\nThrough which my cousin Romney's chimneys smoked\nAs still as when a silent mouth in frost\nBreathes, showing where the woodlands hid Leigh Hall;\nWhile, far above, a jut of table-land,\nA promontory without water, stretched,\u2014\nYou could not catch it if the days were thick,\nOr took it for a cloud; but, otherwise,\nThe vigorous sun would catch it up at eve\nAnd use it for an anvil till he had filled\nThe shelves of heaven with burning thunderbolts,\nProtesting against night and darkness:\u2014then,\nWhen all his setting trouble was resolved\nTo a trance of passive glory, you might see\nIn apparition on the golden sky\n(Alas, my Giotto's background!) the sheep run\nAlong the fine clear outline, small as mice\nThat run along a witch's scarlet thread.\n\nNot a grand nature.\n\nNot my chestnut-woods\nOf Vallombrosa, cleaving by the spurs\nTo the precipices.\n\nNot my headlong leaps\nOf waters, that cry out for joy or fear\nIn leaping through the palpitating pines,\nLike a white soul tossed out to eternity\nWith thrills of time upon it.\n\nNot indeed\nMy multitudinous mountains, sitting in\nThe magic circle, with the mutual touch\nElectric, panting from their full deep hearts\nBeneath the influent heavens, and waiting for\nCommunion and commission.\n\nItaly\nIs one thing, England one.\n\nOn English ground\nYou understand the letter,\u2014ere the fall\nHow Adam lived in a garden.\n\nAll the fields\nAre tied up fast with hedges, nosegay-like;\nThe hills are crumpled plains, the plains parterres,\nThe trees, round, woolly, ready to be clipped,\nAnd if you seek for any wilderness\nYou find, at best, a park.\n\nA nature tamed\nAnd grown domestic like a barn-door fowl,\nWhich does not awe you with its claws and beak,\nNor tempt you to an eyrie too high up,\nBut which, in cackling, sets you thinking of\nYour eggs to-morrow at breakfast, in the pause\nOf finer meditation.\n\nRather say,\nA sweet familiar nature, stealing in\nAs a dog might, or child, to touch your hand\nOr pluck your gown, and humbly mind you so\nOf presence and affection, excellent\nFor inner uses, from the things without.\n\nI could not be unthankful, I who was\nEntreated thus and holpen.\n\nIn the room\nI speak of, ere the house was well awake,\nAnd also after it was well asleep,\nI sat alone, and drew the blessing in\nOf all that nature.\n\nWith a gradual step,\nA stir among the leaves, a breath, a ray,\nIt came in softly, while the angels made\nA place for it beside me.\n\nThe moon came,\nAnd swept my chamber clean of foolish thoughts.\n\nThe sun came, saying, \"Shall I lift this light\nAgainst the lime-tree, and you will not look?\n\nI make the birds sing\u2014listen! but, for you,\nGod never hears your voice, excepting when\nYou lie upon the bed at nights and weep.\n\nThen, something moved me.\n\nThen, I wakened up\nMore slowly than I verily write now,\nBut wholly, at last, I wakened, opened wide\nThe window and my soul, and let the airs\nAnd out-door sights sweep gradual gospels in,\nRegenerating what I was.\n\nO Life,\nHow oft we throw it off and think,\u2014\"Enough,\nEnough of life in so much!\u2014here's a cause\nFor rupture;\u2014herein we must break with Life,\nOr be ourselves unworthy; here we are wronged,\nMaimed, spoiled for aspiration: farewell, Life!\"\nAnd so, as froward babes, we hide our eyes\nAnd think all ended.\n\n\u2014Then, Life calls to us\nIn some transformed, apocalyptic voice,\nAbove us, or below us, or around:\nPerhaps we name it Nature's voice, or Love's,\nTricking ourselves, because we are more ashamed\nTo own our compensations than our griefs:\nStill, Life's voice!\u2014still, we make our peace with Life.\n\nAnd I, so young then, was not sullen.\n\nSoon\nI used to get up early, just to sit\nAnd watch the morning quicken in the gray,\nAnd hear the silence open like a flower\nLeaf after leaf,\u2014and stroke with listless hand\nThe woodbine through the window, till at last\nI came to do it with a sort of love,\nAt foolish unaware: whereat I smiled,\u2014\nA melancholy smile, to catch myself\nSmiling for joy.\n\nCapacity for joy\nAdmits temptation.\n\nIt seemed, next, worth while\nTo dodge the sharp sword set against my life;\nTo slip down stairs through all the sleepy house,\nAs mute as any dream there, and escape\nAs a soul from the body, out of doors,\nGlide through the shrubberies, drop into the lane,\nAnd wander on the hills an hour or two,\nThen back again before the house should stir.\n\nOr else I sat on in my chamber green,\nAnd lived my life, and thought my thoughts, and prayed\nMy prayers without the vicar; read my books,\nWithout considering whether they were fit\nTo do me good.\n\nMark, there.\n\nWe get no good\nBy being ungenerous, even to a book,\nAnd calculating profits,\u2014so much help\nBy so much reading.\n\nIt is rather when\nWe gloriously forget ourselves and plunge\nSoul-forward, headlong, into a book's profound,\nImpassioned for its beauty and salt of truth\u2014\n'Tis then we get the right good from a book.\n\nI read much.\n\nWhat my father taught before\nFrom many a volume, Love re-emphasised\nUpon the self-same pages: Theophrast\nGrew tender with the memory of his eyes,\nAnd \u00c6lian made mine wet.\n\nThe trick of Greek\nAnd Latin he had taught me, as he would\nHave taught me wrestling or the game of fives\nIf such he had known,\u2014most like a shipwrecked man\nWho heaps his single platter with goats' cheese\nAnd scarlet berries; or like any man\nWho loves but one, and so gives all at once,\nBecause he has it, rather than because\nHe counts it worthy.\n\nThus, my father gave;\nAnd thus, as did the women formerly\nBy young Achilles, when they pinned a veil\nAcross the boy's audacious front, and swept\nWith tuneful laughs the silver-fretted rocks,\nHe wrapt his little daughter in his large\nMan's doublet, careless did it fit or no.\n\nBut, after I had read for memory,\nI read for hope.\n\nThe path my father's foot\nHad trod me out (which suddenly broke off\nWhat time he dropped the wallet of the flesh\nAnd passed), alone I carried on, and set\nMy child-heart 'gainst the thorny underwood,\nTo reach the grassy shelter of the trees.\n\nAh babe i' the wood, without a brother-babe!\nMy own self-pity, like the red-breast bird,\nFlies back to

for if\nHe said \"When I was last in Italy,\"\nIt sounded as an instrument that's played\nToo far off for the tune\u2014and yet it's fine\nTo listen.\n\nOfter we walked only two\nIf cousin Romney pleased to walk with me.\n\nWe read, or talked, or quarrelled, as it chanced.\n\nWe were not lovers, nor even friends well-matched:\nSay rather, scholars upon different tracks,\nAnd thinkers disagreed: he, overfull\nOf what is, and I, haply, overbold\nFor what might be.\n\nBut then the thrushes sang,\nAnd shook my pulses and the elms' new leaves:\nAt which I turned, and held my finger up,\nAnd bade him mark that, howsoe'er the world\nWent ill, as he related, certainly\nThe thrushes still sang in it.\n\nAt the word\nHis brow would soften,\u2014and he bore with me\nIn melancholy patience, not unkind,\nWhile breaking into voluble ecstasy\nI flattered all the beauteous country round,\nAs poets use, the skies, the clouds, the fields,\nThe happy violets hiding from the roads\nThe primroses run down to, carrying gold;\nThe tangled hedgerows, where the cows push out\nImpatient horns and tolerant churning mouths\n'Twixt dripping ash-boughs,\u2014hedgerows all alive\nWith birds and gnats and large white butterflies\nWhich look as if the May-flower had caught life\nAnd palpitated forth upon the wind;\nHills, vales, woods, netted in a silver mist,\nFarms, granges, doubled up among the hills;\nAnd cattle grazing in the watered vales,\nAnd cottage-chimneys smoking from the woods,\nAnd cottage-gardens smelling everywhere,\nConfused with smell of orchards.\n\n\"See,\" I said,\n\"And see! is God not with us on the earth?\n\nAnd shall we put Him down by aught we do?\n\nWho says there's nothing for the poor and vile\nSave poverty and wickedness?\n\nbehold!\"\nAnd ankle-deep in English grass I leaped\nAnd clapped my hands, and called all very fair.\n\nIn the beginning when God called all good,\nEven then was evil near us, it is writ;\nBut we indeed who call things good and fair,\nThe evil is upon us while we speak;\nDeliver us from evil, let us pray.\n", "period": "Victorian", "literary_movement": "Victorian Poetry", "register": "Formal", "rhetorical_genre": "Deliberative", "discursive_structure": "Monologue", "discourse_type": "Expository", "narrative_level": "Third person internal", "diegetic_mimetic": "Mimetic", "focalization": "Internal", "person": "Female", "deictic_orientation": "First person", "addressee_type": "Implied", "deictic_object": "The sun", "temporal_orientation": "Past", "temporal_structure": "Linear", "tradition": "British Romanticism", "mode": "Narrative", "genre": "Long Poem", "stanza_structure": "Quatrains", "meter": "Iambic pentameter", "rhyme": "AABB"}

(Dante)\nImmaginata guida la conduce.\n\n(Petrarch)\nI dream of you to wake: would that I might\nDream of you and not wake but slumber on;\nNor find with dreams the dear companion gone,\nAs summer ended summer birds take flight.\n\nIn happy dreams I hold you full in sight,\nI blush again who waking look so wan;\nBrighter than sunniest day that ever shone,\nIn happy dreams your smile makes day of night.\n\nThus only in a dream we are at one,\nThus only in a dream we give and take\nThe faith that maketh rich who take or give;\nIf thus to sleep is sweeter than to wake,\nTo die were surely sweeter than to live,\nThough there be nothing new beneath the sun.\n\n4\nPoca favilla gran fliamma seconda.\n\n(Dante)\nOgni altra cosa, ogni pensier va fore,\nE sol ivi con voi rimansi amore.\n\n(Petrarch)\nI loved you first: but afterwards your love\nOutsoaring mine, sang such a loftier song\nAs drowned the friendly cooings of my dove.\n\nWhich owes the other most?\n\nMy love was long,\nAnd yours one moment seemed to wax more strong;\nI loved and guessed at you, you construed me -\nAnd loved me for what might or might not be\nNay, weights and measures do us both a wrong.\n\nFor verily love knows not \u2018mine\u2019 or \u2018thine;\u2019\nWith separate \u2018I\u2019 and \u2018thou\u2019 free love has done,\nFor one is both and both are one in love:\nRich love knows nought of \u2018thine that is not mine;\u2019\nBoth have the strength and both the length thereof,\nBoth of us, of the love which makes us one.\n\n5\nAmor che a nullo amato amar perdona.\n\n(Dante)\nAmor m'addusse in s\u00ec gioiosa spene.\n\n(Petrarch)\nO my heart's heart, and you who are to me\nMore than myself myself, God be with you,\nKeep you in strong obedience leal and true\nTo Him whose noble service setteth free,\nGive you all good we see or can foresee,\nMake your joys many and your sorrows few,\nBless you in what you bear and what you do,\nYea, perfect you as He would have you be.\n\nSo much for you; but what for me, dear friend?\n\nTo love you without stint and all I can\nToday, tomorrow, world without an end;\nTo love you much and yet to love you more,\nAs Jordan at his flood sweeps either shore;\nSince woman is the helpmeet made for man.\n\n6\nOr puoi la quantitate\nComprender de l'amor che a te mi scalda.\n\n(Dante)\nNon vo' che da tal nodo mi scioglia.\n\n(Petrarch)\nTrust me, I have not earned your dear rebuke,\nI love, as you would have me, God the most;\nWould lose not Him, but you, must one be lost,\nNor with Lot's wife cast back a faithless look\nUnready to forego what I forsook;\nThis say I, having counted up the cost,\nThis, though I be the feeblest of God's host,\nThe sorriest sheep Christ shepherds with His crook.\n\nYet while I love my God the most, I deem\nThat I can never love you overmuch;\nI love Him more, so let me love you too;\nYea, as I apprehend it, love is such\nI cannot love you if I love not Him,\nI cannot love Him if I love not you.\n\n7\nQui primavera sempre ed ogni frutto.\n\n(Dante)\nRagionando con meco ed io con lui.\n\n(Petrarch)\n\u2018Love me, for I love you\u2019 - and answer me,\n\u2018Love me, for I love you\u2019 - so shall we stand\nAs happy equals in the flowering land\nOf love, that knows not a dividing sea.\n\nLove builds the house on rock and not on sand,\nLove laughs what while the winds rave desperately;\nAnd who hath found love's citadel unmanned?\n\nAnd who hath held in bonds love's liberty?\n\nMy heart's a coward though my words are brave\nWe meet so seldom, yet we surely part\nSo often; there's a problem for your art!\nStill I find comfort in his Book, who saith,\nThough jealousy be cruel as the grave,\nAnd death be strong, yet love is strong as death.\n\n8\nCome dicesse a Dio: D'altro non calme.\n\n(Dante)\nSpero trovar piet\u00e0 non che perdono.\n\n(Petrarch)\n\u2018I, if I perish, perish\u2019 - Esther spake:\nAnd bride of life or death she made her fair\nIn all the lustre of her perfumed hair\nAnd smiles that kindle longing but to slake.\n\nShe put on pomp of loveliness, to take\nHer husband through his eyes at unaware;\nShe spread abroad her beauty for a snare,\nHarmless as doves and subtle as a snake.\n\nShe trapped him with one mesh of silken hair,\nShe vanquished him by wisdom of her wit,\nAnd built her people's house that it should stand: -\nIf I might take my life so in my hand,\nAnd for my love to Love put up my prayer,\nAnd for love's sake by Love be granted it!\n9\nO dignitosa coscienza e netta!

all night long\nHe had lain wakeful, tossing on his bed;\nBut when the grey dawn stole into his tent,\nHe rose, and clad himself, and girt his sword,\nAnd took his horseman's cloak, and left his tent,\nAnd went abroad into the cold wet fog,\nThrough the dim camp to Peran-Wisa's tent.\n\nThrough the black Tartar tents he pass'd, which stood\nClustering like bee-hives on the low flat strand\nOf Oxus, where the summer-floods o'erflow\nWhen the sun melts the snows in high Pamere;\nThrough the black tents he pass'd, o'er that low strand,\nAnd to a hillock came, a little back\nFrom the stream's brink\u2014the spot where first a boat,\nCrossing the stream in summer, scrapes the land.\n\nThe men of former times had crown'd the top\nWith a clay fort; but that was fall'n, and now\nThe Tartars built there Peran-Wisa's tent,\nA dome of laths, and o'er it felts were spread.\n\nAnd Sohrab came there, and went in, and stood\nUpon the thick piled carpets in the tent,\nAnd found the old man sleeping on his bed\nOf rugs and felts, and near him lay his arms.\n\nAnd Peran-Wisa heard him, though the step\nWas dull'd; for he slept light, an old man's sleep;\nAnd he rose quickly on one arm, and said:\u2014\n\n\"Who art thou?\n\nfor it is not yet clear dawn.\n\nSpeak! is there news, or any night alarm?\n\n\nBut Sohrab came to the bedside, and said:\u2014\n\"Thou know'st me, Peran-Wisa! it is I.\n\nThe sun is not yet risen, and the foe\nSleep; but I sleep not; all night long I lie\nTossing and wakeful, and I come to thee.\n\nFor so did King Afrasiab bid me seek\nThy counsel, and to heed thee as thy son,\nIn Samarcand, before the army march'd;\nAnd I will tell thee what my heart desires.\n\nThou know'st if, since from Ader-baijan first\nI came among the Tartars and bore arms,\nI have still served Afrasiab well, and shown,\nAt my boy's years, the courage of a man.\n\nThis too thou know'st, that while I still bear on\nThe conquering Tartar ensigns through the world,\nAnd beat the Persians back on every field,\nI seek one man, one man, and one alone\u2014\nRustum, my father; who I hoped should greet,\nShould one day greet, upon some well-fought field,\nHis not unworthy, not inglorious son.\n\nSo I long hoped, but him I never find.\n\nCome then, hear now, and grant me what I ask.\n\nLet the two armies rest to-day; but I\nWill challenge forth the bravest Persian lords\nTo meet me, man to man; if I prevail,\nRustum will surely hear it; if I fall\u2014\nOld man, the dead need no one, claim no kin.\n\nDim is the rumour of a common fight,\nWhere host meets host, and many names are sunk;\nBut of a single combat fame speaks clear.\n\n\nHe spoke; and Peran-Wisa took the hand\nOf the young man in his, and sigh'd, and said:\u2014\n\n\"O Sohrab, an unquiet heart is thine!\nCanst thou not rest among the Tartar chiefs,\nAnd share the battle's common chance with us\nWho love thee, but must press for ever first,\nIn single fight incurring single risk,\nTo find a father thou hast never seen?\n\nThat were far best, my son, to stay with us\nUnmurmuring; in our tents, while it is war,\nAnd when 'tis truce, then in Afrasiab's towns.\n\nBut, if this one desire indeed rules all,\nTo seek out Rustum\u2014seek him not through fight!\nSeek him in peace, and carry to his arms,\nO Sohrab, carry an unwounded son!\nBut far hence seek him, for he is not here.\n\nFor now it is not as when I was young,\nWhen Rustum was in front of every fray;\nBut now he keeps apart, and sits at home,\nIn Seistan, with Zal, his father old.\n\nWhether that his own mighty strength at last\nFeels the abhorr'd approaches of old age,\nOr in some quarrel with the Persian King.\n\nThere go!\u2014Thou wilt not?\n\nYet my heart forebodes\nDanger or death awaits thee on this field.\n\nFain would I know thee safe and well, though lost\nTo us; fain therefore send thee hence, in peace\nTo seek thy father, not seek single fights\nIn vain;\u2014but who can keep the lion's cub\nFrom ravening, and who govern Rustum's son?\n\nGo, I will grant thee what thy heart desires.\n\n\nSo said he, and dropp'd Sohrab's hand, and left\nHis bed, and the warm rugs whereon he lay;\nAnd o'er his chilly limbs his woollen coat\nHe pass'd, and tied his sandals on his feet,\nAnd threw a white cloak round him, and he took\nIn his right hand a ruler's staff, no sword;\nAnd on his head he set his sheep-skin cap,\nBlack, glossy, curl'd, the fleece of Kara-Kul;\nAnd raised the curtain of his tent, and call'd\nHis herald to his side, and went abroad.\n\nThe sun by this had risen, and clear'd the fog\nFrom the broad Oxus and the glittering sands.\n\nAnd from their tents the Tartar horsemen filed\nInto the open plain; so Haman bade\u2014\nHaman, who next to Peran-Wisa ruled\nThe host, and still was in his lusty prime.\n\nFrom their black tents, long files of horse, they stream'd;\nAs when some grey November morn the files,\nIn marching order spread, of long-neck'd cranes\nStream over Casbin and the southern slopes\nOf Elburz, from the Aralian estuaries,\nOr some frore Caspian reed-bed, southward bound\nFor the warm Persian sea-board\u2014so they stream'd.\n\nThe Tartars of the Oxus, the King's guard,\nFirst, with black sheep-skin caps and with long spears;\nLarge men, large steeds; who from Bokhara come\nAnd Khiva, and ferment the milk of mares.\n\nNext, the more temperate Toorkmuns of the south,\nThe Tukas, and the lances of Salore,\nAnd those from Attruck and the Caspian sands;\nLight men and on light steeds, who only drink\nThe acrid milk of camels, and their wells.\n\nAnd then a swarm of wandering horse, who came\nFrom far, and a more doubtful service own'd;\nThe Tartars of Ferghana, from the banks\nOf the Jaxartes, men with scanty beards\nAnd close-set skull-caps; and those wilder hordes\nWho roam o'er Kipchak and the northern waste,\nKalmucks and unkempt Kuzzaks, tribes who stray\nNearest the Pole, and wandering Kirghizzes,\nWho come on shaggy ponies from Pamere;\nThese all filed out from camp into the plain.\n\nAnd on the other side the Persians form'd;\u2014\nFirst a light cloud of horse, Tartars they seem'd,\nThe Ilyats of Khorassan, and behind,\nThe royal troops of Persia, horse and foot,\nMarshall'd battalions bright in burnish'd steel.\n\nBut Peran-Wisa with his herald came,\nThreading the Tartar squadrons to the front,\nAnd with his staff kept back the foremost ranks.\n\nAnd when Ferood, who led the Persians, saw\nThat Peran-Wisa kept the Tartars back,\nHe took his spear, and to the front he came,\nAnd check'd his ranks, and fix'd them where they stood.\n\nAnd the old Tartar came upon the sand\nBetwixt the silent hosts, and spake, and said:\u2014\n\n\"Ferood, and ye, Persians and Tartars, hear!\nLet there be truce between the hosts to-day.\n\nBut choose a champion from the Persian lords\nTo fight our champion Sohrab, man to man.\n\n\nAs, in the country, on a morn in June,\nWhen the dew glistens on the pearled ears,\nA shiver runs through the deep corn for joy\u2014\nSo, when they heard what Peran-Wisa said,\nA thrill through all the Tartar squadrons ran\nOf pride and hope for Sohrab, whom they loved.\n\nBut as a troop of pedlars, from Cabool,\nCross underneath the Indian Caucasus,\nThat vast sky-neighbouring mountain of milk snow;\nCrossing so high, that, as they mount, they pass\nLong flocks of travelling birds dead on the snow,\nChoked by the air, and scarce can they themselves\nSlake their parch'd throats with sugar'd mulberries\u2014\nIn single file they move, and stop their breath,\nFor fear they should dislodge the o'erhanging snows\u2014\nSo the pale Persians held their breath with fear.\n\nAnd to Ferood his brother chiefs came up\nTo counsel; Gudurz and Zoarrah came,\nAnd Feraburz, who ruled the Persian host\nSecond, and was the uncle of the King;\nThese came and counsell'd, and then Gudurz said:\u2014\n\n\"Ferood, shame bids us take their challenge up,\nYet champion have we none to match this youth.\n\nHe has the wild stag's foot, the lion's heart.\n\nBut Rustum came last night; aloof he sits\nAnd sullen, and has pitch'd his tents apart.\n\nHim will I seek, and carry to his ear\nThe Tartar challenge, and this young man's name.\n\nHaply he will forget his wrath, and fight.\n\nStand forth the while, and take their challenge up.\n\n\nSo spake he; and Ferood stood forth and cried:\u2014\n\"Old man, be it agreed as thou hast said!\nLet Sohrab arm, and we will find a man.\n\n\nHe spake: and Peran-Wisa turn'd, and strode\nBack through the opening squadrons to his tent.\n\nBut through the anxious Persians Gudurz ran,\nAnd cross'd the camp which lay behind, and reach'd,\nOut on the sands beyond it, Rustum's tents.\n\nOf scarlet cloth they were, and glittering gay,\nJust pitch'd; the high pavilion in the midst\nWas Rustum's, and his men lay camp'd around.\n\nAnd Gudurz enter'd Rustum's tent, and found\nRustum; his morning meal was done, but still\nThe table stood before him, charged with food\u2014\nA side of roasted sheep, and cakes of bread,\nAnd dark green melons; and there Rustum sate\nListless, and held a falcon on his wrist,\nAnd play'd with it; but Gudurz came and stood\nBefore him; and he look'd, and saw him stand,\nAnd with a cry sprang up and dropp'd the bird,\nAnd greeted Gudurz with both hands, and said:\u2014\n\n\"Welcome! these eyes could see no better sight.\n\nWhat news?\n\nbut sit down first, and eat and drink.\n\n\nBut Gudurz stood in the tent-door, and said:\u2014\n\"Not now! a time will come to eat and drink,\nBut not to-day; to-day has other needs.\n\nThe armies are drawn out, and stand at gaze;\nFor from the Tartars is a challenge brought\nTo pick a champion from the Persian lords\nTo fight their champion\u2014and thou know'st his name\u2014\nSohrab men call him, but his birth is hid.\n\nO Rustum, like thy might is this young man's!\nHe has the wild stag's foot, the lion's heart;\nAnd he is young, and Iran's chiefs are old,\nOr else too weak; and all eyes turn to thee.\n\nCome down and help us, Rustum, or we lose!''\n\nHe spoke; but Rustum answer'd with a smile:\u2014\n\"Go to! if Iran's chiefs are old, then I\nAm older; if the young are weak, the King\nErrs strangely; for the King, for Kai Khosroo,\nHimself is young, and honours younger men,\nAnd lets the aged moulder to their graves.\n\nRustum he loves no more, but loves the young\u2014\nThe young may rise at Sohrab's vaunts, not I.\n\nFor what care I, though all speak Sohrab's fame?\n\nFor would that I myself had such a son,\nAnd not that one slight helpless girl I have\u2014\nA son so famed, so brave, to send to war,\nAnd I to tarry with the snow-hair'd Zal,\nMy father, whom the robber Afghans vex,\nAnd clip his borders short, and drive his herds,\nAnd he has none to guard his weak old age.\n\nThere would I go, and hang my armour up,\nAnd with my great name fence that weak old man,\nAnd spend the goodly treasures I have got,\nAnd rest my age, and hear of Sohrab's fame,\nAnd leave to death the hosts of thankless kings,\nAnd with these slaughterous hands draw sword no more.\n\n\nHe spoke, and smiled; and Gudurz made reply:\u2014\n\"What then, O Rustum, will men say to this,\nWhen Sohrab dares our bravest forth, and seeks\nThee most of all, and thou, whom most he seeks,\nHidest thy face?\n\nTake heed lest men should say:\nLike some old miser, Rustum hoards his fame,\nAnd shuns to peril it with younger men.\n\n\nAnd, greatly moved, then Rustum made reply:\u2014\n\"O Gudurz, wherefore dost thou say such words?\n\nThou knowest better words than this to say.\n\nWhat is one more, one less, obscure or famed,\nValiant or craven, young or old, to me?\n\nAre not they mortal, am not I myself?\n\nBut who for men of nought would do great deeds?\n\nCome, thou shalt see how Rustum hoards his fame!\nBut I will fight unknown, and in plain arms;\nLet not men say of Rustum, he was match'd\nIn single fight with any mortal man.\n\n\nHe spoke, and frown'd; and Gudurz turn'd, and ran\nBack quickly through the camp in fear and joy\u2014\nFear at his wrath, but joy that Rustum came.\n\nBut Rustum strode to his tent-door, and call'd\nHis followers in, and bade them bring his arms,\nAnd clad himself in steel; the arms he chose\nWere plain, and on his shield was no device,\nOnly his helm was rich, inlaid with gold,\nAnd, from the fluted spine atop, a plume\nOf horsehair waved, a scarlet horsehair plume.\n\nSo arm'd, he issued forth; and Ruksh, his horse,\nFollow'd him like a faithful hound at heel\u2014\nRuksh, whose renown was noised through all the earth,\nThe horse, whom Rustum on a foray once\nDid in Bokhara by the river find\nA colt beneath its dam, and drove him home,\nAnd rear'd him; a bright bay, with lofty crest,\nDight with a saddle-cloth of broider'd green\nCrusted with gold, and on the ground were work'd\nAll beasts of chase, all beasts which hunters know.\n\nSo follow'd, Rustum left his tents, and cross'd\nThe camp, and to the Persian host appear'd.\n\nAnd all the Persians knew him, and with shouts\nHail'd; but the Tartars knew not who he was.\n\nAnd dear as the wet diver to the eyes\nOf his pale wife who waits and weeps on shore,\nBy sandy Bahrein, in the Persian Gulf,\nPlunging all day in the blue waves, at night,\nHaving made up his tale of precious pearls,\nRejoins her in their hut upon the sands\u2014\nSo dear to the pale Persians Rustum came.\n\nAnd Rustum to the Persian front advanced,\nAnd Sohrab arm'd in Haman's tent, and came.\n\nAnd as afield the reapers cut a swath\nDown through the middle of a rich man's corn,\nAnd on each side are squares of standing corn,\nAnd in the midst a stubble, short and bare\u2014\nSo on each side were squares of men, with spears\nBristling, and in the midst, the open sand.\n\nAnd Rustum came upon the sand, and cast\nHis eyes toward the Tartar tents, and saw\nSohrab come forth, and eyed him as he came.\n\nAs some rich woman, on a winter's morn,\nEyes through her silken curtains the poor drudge\nWho with numb blacken'd fingers makes her fire\u2014\nAt cock-crow, on a starlit winter's morn,\nWhen the frost flowers the whiten'd window-panes\u2014\nAnd wonders how she lives, and what the thoughts\nOf that poor drudge may be; so Rustum eyed\nThe unknown adventurous youth, who from afar\nCame seeking Rustum, and defying forth\nAll the most valiant chiefs; long he perused\nHis spirited air, and wonder'd who he was.\n\nFor very young he seem'd, tenderly rear'd;\nLike some young cypress, tall, and dark, and straight,\nWhich in a queen's secluded garden throws\nIts slight dark shadow on the moonlit turf,\nBy midnight, to a bubbling fountain's sound\u2014\nSo slender Sohrab seem'd, so softly rear'd.\n\nAnd a deep pity enter'd Rustum's soul\nAs he beheld him coming; and he stood,\nAnd beckon'd to him with his hand, and said:\u2014\n\n\"O thou young man, the air of Heaven is soft,\nAnd warm, and pleasant; but the grave is cold!\nHeaven's air is better than the cold dead grave.\n\nBehold me! I am vast, and clad in iron,\nAnd tried; and I have stood on many a field\nOf blood, and I have fought with many a foe\u2014\nNever was that field lost, or that foe saved.\n\nO Sohrab, wherefore wilt thou rush on death?\n\nBe govern'd! quit the Tartar host, and come\nTo Iran, and be as my son to me,\nAnd fight beneath my banner till I die!\nThere are no youths in Iran brave as thou.\n\n\nSo he spake, mildly; Sohrab heard his voice,\nThe mighty voice of Rustum, and he saw\nHis giant figure planted on the sand,\nSole, like some single tower, which a chief\nHath builded on the waste in former years\nAgainst the robbers; and he saw that head,\nStreak'd with its first grey hairs;\u2014hope filled his soul,\nAnd he ran forward and embraced his knees,\nAnd clasp'd his hand within his own, and said:\u2014\n\n\"O, by thy father's head! by thine own soul!\nArt thou not Rustum?\n\nspeak! art thou not he?\n\n\nBut Rustum eyed askance the kneeling youth,\nAnd turn'd away, and spake to his own soul:\u2014\n\n\"Ah me, I muse what this young fox may mean!\nFalse, wily, boastful, are these Tartar boys.\n\nFor if I now confess this thing he asks,\nAnd hide it not, but say:Rustum is here!\nHe will not yield indeed, nor quit our foes,\nBut he will find some pretext not to fight,\nAnd praise my fame, and proffer courteous gifts,\nA belt or sword perhaps, and go his way.\n\nAnd on a feast-tide, in Afrasiab's hall,\nIn Samarcand, he will arise and cry:\n'I challenged once, when the two armies camp'd\nBeside the Oxus, all the Persian lords\nTo cope with me in single fight; but they\nShrank, only Rustum dared; then he and I\nChanged gifts, and went on equal terms away.\n\nSo will he speak, perhaps, while men applaud;\nThen were the chiefs of Iran shamed through me.\n\n\nAnd then he turn'd, and sternly spake aloud:\u2014\n\"Rise! wherefore dost thou vainly question thus\nOf Rustum?\n\nI am here, whom thou hast call'd\nBy challenge forth; make good thy vaunt, or yield!\nIs it with Rustum only thou wouldst fight?\n\nRash boy, men look on Rustum's face and flee!\nFor well I know, that did great Rustum stand\nBefore thy face this day, and were reveal'd,\nThere would be then no talk of fighting more.\n\nBut being what I am, I tell thee this\u2014\nDo thou record it in thine inmost soul:\nEither thou shalt renounce thy vaunt and yield,\nOr else thy bones shall strew this sand, till winds\nBleach them, or Oxus with his summer-floods,\nOxus in summer wash them all away.\n\n\nHe spoke; and Sohrab answer'd, on his feet:\u2014\n\"Art thou so fierce?\n\nThou wilt not fright me so!\nI am no girl, to be made pale by words.\n\nYet this thou hast said well, did Rustum stand\nHere on this field, there were no fighting then.\n\nBut Rustum is far hence, and we stand here.\n\nBegin! thou art more vast, more dread than I,\nAnd thou art proved, I know, and I am young\u2014\nBut yet success sways with the breath of Heaven.\n\nAnd though thou thinkest that thou knowest sure\nThy victory, yet thou canst not surely know.\n\nFor we are all, like swimmers in the sea,\nPoised on the top of a huge wave of fate,\nWhich hangs uncertain to which side to fall.\n\nAnd whether it will heave us up to land,\nOr whether it will roll us out to sea,\nBack out to sea, to the deep waves of death,\nWe know not, and no search will make us know;\nOnly the event will teach us in its hour.\n\n\nHe spoke, and Rustum answer'd not, but hurl'd\nHis spear; down from the shoulder, down it came,\nAs on some partridge in the corn a hawk,\nThat long has tower'd in the airy clouds,\nDrops like a plummet; Sohrab saw it come,\nAnd sprang aside, quick as a flash; the spear\nHiss'd, and went quivering down into the sand,\nWhich it sent flying wide;\u2014then Sohrab threw\nIn turn, and full struck Rustum's shield; sharp rang,\nThe iron plates rang sharp, but turn'd the spear.\n\nAnd Rustum seized his club, which none but he\nCould wield; an unlopp'd trunk it was, and huge,\nStill rough\u2014like those which men in treeless plains\nTo build them boats fish from the flooded rivers,\nHyphasis or Hydaspes, when, high up\nBy their dark springs, the wind in winter-time\nHath made in Himalayan forests wrack,\nAnd strewn the channels with torn boughs\u2014so huge\nThe club which Rustum lifted now, and struck\nOne stroke; but again Sohrab sprang aside,\nLithe as the glancing snake, and the club came\nThundering to earth, and leapt from Rustum's hand.\n\nAnd Rustum follow'd his own blow, and fell\nTo his knees, and with his fingers clutch'd the sand;\nAnd now might Sohrab have unsheathed his sword,\nAnd pierced the mighty Rustum while he lay\nDizzy, and on his knees, and choked with sand;\nBut he look'd on, and smiled, nor bared his sword,\nBut courteously drew back, and spoke, and said:\u2014\n\n\"Thou strik'st too hard! that club of thine will float\nUpon the summer-floods, and not my bones.\n\nBut rise, and be not wroth! not wroth am I;\nNo, when I see thee, wrath forsakes my soul.\n\nThou say'st, thou art not Rustum; be it so!\nWho art thou then, that canst so touch my soul?\n\nBoy as I am, I have seen battles too\u2014\nHave waded foremost in their bloody waves,\nAnd heard their hollow roar of dying men;\nBut never was my heart thus touch'd before.\n\nAre they from Heaven, these softenings of the heart?\n\nO thou old warrior, let us yield to Heaven!\nCome, plant we here in earth our angry spears,\nAnd make a truce, and sit upon this sand,\nAnd pledge each other in red wine, like friends,\nAnd thou shalt talk to me of Rustum's deeds.\n\nThere are enough foes in the Persian host,\nWhom I may meet, and strike, and feel no pang;\nChampions enough Afrasiab has, whom thou\nMayst fight; fightthem, when they confront thy spear!\nBut oh, let there be peace 'twixt thee and me!\"\n\nHe ceased, but while he spake, Rustum had risen,\nAnd stood erect, trembling with rage; his club\nHe left to lie, but had regain'd his spear,\nWhose fiery point now in his mail'd right-hand\nBlazed bright and baleful, like that autumn-star,\nThe baleful sign of fevers; dust had soil'd\nHis stately crest, and dimm'd his glittering arms.\n\nHis breast heaved, his lips foam'd, and twice his voice\nWas choked with rage; at last these words broke way:\u2014\n\n\"Girl! nimble with thy feet, not with thy hands!\nCurl'd minion, dancer, coiner of sweet words!\nFight, let me hear thy hateful voice no more!\nThou art not in Afrasiab's gardens now\nWith Tartar girls, with whom thou art wont to dance;\nBut on the Oxus-sands, and in the dance\nOf battle, and with me, who make no play\nOf war; I fight it out, and hand to hand.\n\nSpeak not to me of truce, and pledge, and wine!\nRemember all thy valour; try thy feints\nAnd cunning! all the pity I had is gone;\nBecause thou hast shamed me before both the hosts\nWith thy light skipping tricks, and thy girl's wiles.\n\n\nHe spoke, and Sohrab kindled at his taunts,\nAnd he too drew his sword; at once they rush'd\nTogether, as two eagles on one prey\nCome rushing down together from the clouds,\nOne from the east, one from the west; their shields\nDash'd with a clang together, and a din\nRose, such as that the sinewy woodcutters\nMake often in the forest's heart at morn,\nOf hewing axes, crashing trees\u2014such blows\nRustum and Sohrab on each other hail'd.\n\nAnd you would say that sun and stars took part\nIn that unnatural conflict; for a cloud\nGrew suddenly in Heaven, and dark'd the sun\nOver the fighters' heads; and a wind rose\nUnder their feet, and moaning swept the plain,\nAnd in a sandy whirlwind wrapp'd the pair.\n\nIn gloom they twain were wrapp'd, and they alone;\nFor both the on-looking hosts on either hand\nStood in broad daylight, and the sky was pure,\nAnd the sun sparkled on the Oxus stream.\n\nBut in the gloom they fought, with bloodshot eyes\nAnd labouring breath; first Rustum struck the shield\nWhich Sohrab held stiff out; the steel-spiked spear\nRent the tough plates, but fail'd to reach the skin,\nAnd Rustum pluck'd it back with angry groan.\n\nThen Sohrab with his sword smote Rustum's helm,\nNor clove its steel quite through; but all the crest\nHe shore away, and that proud horsehair plume,\nNever till now defiled, sank to the dust;\nAnd Rustum bow'd his head; but then the gloom\nGrew blacker, thunder rumbled in the air,\nAnd lightnings rent the cloud; and Ruksh, the horse,\nWho stood at hand, utter'd a dreadful cry;\u2014\nNo horse's cry was that, most like the roar\nOf some pain'd desert-lion, who all day\nHath trail'd the hunter's javelin in his side,\nAnd comes at night to die upon the sand.\n\nThe two hosts heard that cry, and quaked for fear,\nAnd Oxus curdled as it cross'd his stream.\n\nBut Sohrab heard, and quail'd not, but rush'd on,\nAnd struck again; and again Rustum bow'd\nHis head; but this time all the blade, like glass,\nSprang in a thousand shivers on the helm,\nAnd in the hand the hilt remain'd alone.\n\nThen Rustum raised his head; his dreadful eyes\nGlared, and he shook on high his menacing spear,\nAnd shouted:Rustum!\u2014Sohrab heard that shout,\nAnd shrank amazed; back he recoil'd one step,\nAnd scann'd with blinking eyes the advancing form,\nAnd then he stood bewilder'd; and he dropp'd\nHis covering shield, and the spear pierced his side.\n\nHe reel'd, and staggering back, sank to the ground;\nAnd then the gloom dispersed, and the wind fell,\nAnd the bright sun broke forth, and melted all\nThe cloud; and the two armies saw the pair\u2014\nSaw Rustum standing, safe upon his feet,\nAnd Sohrab, wounded, on the bloody sand.\n\nThen, with a bitter smile, Rustum began:\u2014\n\"Sohrab, thou thoughtest in thy mind to kill\nA Persian lord this day, and strip his corpse,\nAnd bear thy trophies to Afrasiab's tent.\n\nOr else that the great Rustum would come down\nHimself to fight, and that thy wiles would move\nHis heart to take a gift, and let thee go.\n\nAnd then that all the Tartar host would praise\nThy courage or thy craft, and spread thy fame,\nTo glad thy father in his weak old age.\n\nFool, thou art slain, and by an unknown man!\nDearer to the red jackals shalt thou be\nThan to thy friends, and to thy father old.\n\n\nAnd, with a fearless mien, Sohrab replied:\u2014\n\"Unknown thou art; yet thy fierce vaunt is vain.\n\nThou dost not slay me, proud and boastful man!\nNo! Rustum slays me, and this filial heart.\n\nFor were I match'd with ten such men as thee,\nAnd I were that which till to-day I was,\nThey should be lying here, I standing there.\n\nBut that belov\u00e9d name unnerved my arm\u2014\nThat name, and something, I confess, in thee,\nWhich troubles all my heart, and made my shield\nFall; and thy spear transfix'd an unarm'd foe.\n\nAnd now thou boastest, and insult'st my fate.\n\nBut hear thou this, fierce man, tremble to hear:\nThe mighty Rustum shall avenge my death!\nMy father, whom I seek through all the world,\nHe shall avenge my death, and punish thee!\"\n\nAs when some hunter in the spring hath found\nA breeding eagle sitting on her nest,\nUpon the craggy isle of a hill-lake,\nAnd pierced her with an arrow as she rose,\nAnd follow'd her to find her where she fell\nFar off;\u2014anon her mate comes winging back\nFrom hunting, and a great way off descries\nHis huddling young left sole; at that, he checks\nHis pinion, and with short uneasy sweeps\nCircles above his eyry, with loud screams\nChiding his mate back to her nest; but she\nLies dying, with the arrow in her side,\nIn some far stony gorge out of his ken,\nA heap of fluttering feathers\u2014never more\nShall the lake glass her, flying over it;\nNever the black and dripping precipices\nEcho her stormy scream as she sails by\u2014\nAs that poor bird flies home, nor knows his loss,\nSo Rustum knew not his own loss, but stood\nOver his dying son, and knew him not.\n\nBut, with a cold, incredulous voice, he said:\u2014\n\"What prate is this of fathers and revenge?\n\nThe mighty Rustum never had a son.\n\n\nAnd, with a failing voice, Sohrab replied:\u2014\n\"Ah yes, he had! and that lost son am I.\n\nSurely the news will one day reach his ear,\nReach Rustum, where he sits, and tarries long,\nSomewhere, I know not where, but far from here;\nAnd pierce him like a stab, and make him leap\nTo arms, and cry for vengeance upon thee.\n\nFierce man, bethink thee, for an only son!\nWhat will that grief, what will that vengeance be?\n\nOh, could I live, till I that grief had seen!\nYet him I pity not so much, but her,\nMy mother, who in Ader-baijan dwells\nWith that old king, her father, who grows grey\nWith age, and rules over the valiant Koords.\n\nHer most I pity, who no more will see\nSohrab returning from the Tartar camp,\nWith spoils and honour, when the war is done.\n\nBut a dark rumour will be bruited up,\nFrom tribe to tribe, until it reach her ear;\nAnd then will that defenceless woman learn\nThat Sohrab will rejoice her sight no more,\nBut that in battle with a nameless foe,\nBy the far-distant Oxus, he is slain.\n\n\nHe spoke; and as he ceased, he wept aloud,\nThinking of her he left, and his own death.\n\nHe spoke; but Rustum listen'd, plunged in thought.\n\nNor did he yet believe it was his son\nWho spoke, although he call'd back names he knew;\nFor he had had sure tidings that the babe,\nWhich was in Ader-baijan born to him,\nHad been a puny girl, no boy at all\u2014\nSo that sad mother sent him word, for fear\nRustum should seek the boy, to train in arms.\n\nAnd so he deem'd that either Sohrab took,\nBy a false boast, the style of Rustum's son;\nOr that men gave it him, to swell his fame.\n\nSo deem'd he; yet he listen'd, plunged in thought\nAnd his soul set to grief, as the vast tide\nOf the bright rocking Ocean sets to shore\nAt the full moon; tears gather'd in his eyes;\nFor he remember'd his own early youth,\nAnd all its bounding rapture; as, at dawn,\nThe shepherd from his mountain-lodge descries\nA far, bright city, smitten by the sun,\nThrough many rolling clouds\u2014so Rustum saw\nHis youth; saw Sohrab's mother, in her bloom;\nAnd that old king, her father, who loved well\nHis wandering guest, and gave him his fair child\nWith joy; and all the pleasant life they led,\nThey three, in that long-distant summer-time\u2014\nThe castle, and the dewy woods, and hunt\nAnd hound, and morn on those delightful hills\nIn Ader-baijan.\n\nAnd he saw that Youth,\nOf age and looks to be his own dear son,\nPiteous and lovely, lying on the sand,\nLike some rich hyacinth which by the scythe\nOf an unskilful gardener has been cut,\nMowing the garden grass-plots near its bed,\nAnd lies, a fragrant tower of purple bloom,\nOn the mown, dying grass\u2014so Sohrab lay,\nLovely in death, upon the common sand.\n\nAnd Rustum gazed on him with grief, and said:\u2014\n\n\"O Sohrab, thou indeed art such a son\nWhom Rustum, wert thou his, might well have loved!\nYet here thou errest, Sohrab, or else men\nHave told thee false\u2014thou art not Rustum's son.\n\nFor Rustum had no son; one child he had\u2014\nBut one\u2014a girl; who with her mother now\nPlies some light female task, nor dreams of us\u2014\nOf us she dreams not, nor of wounds, nor war.\n\n\nBut Sohrab answer'd him in wrath: for now\nThe anguish of the deep-fix'd spear grew fierce,\nAnd he desired to draw forth the steel,\nAnd let the blood flow free, and so to die\u2014\nBut first he would convince his stubborn foe;\nAnd, rising sternly on one arm, he said:\u2014\n\n\"Man, who art thou who dost deny my words?\n\nTruth sits upon the lips of dying men,\nAnd falsehood, while I lived, was far from mine.\n\nI tell thee, prick'd upon this arm I bear\nThat seal which Rustum to my mother gave,\nThat she might prick it on the babe she bore.\n\n\nHe spoke; and all the blood left Rustum's cheeks,\nAnd his knees totter'd, and he smote his hand\nAgainst his breast, his heavy mailed hand,\nThat the hard iron corslet clank'd aloud;\nAnd to his heart he press'd the other hand,\nAnd in a hollow voice he spake, and said:\u2014\n\n\"Sohrab, that were a proof which could not lie!\nIf thou show this, then art thou Rustum's son.\n\n\nThen, with weak hasty fingers, Sohrab loosed\nHis belt, and near the shoulder bared his arm,\nAnd show'd a sign in faint vermilion points\nPrick'd; as a cunning workman, in Pekin,\nPricks with vermilion some clear porcelain vase,\nAn emperor's gift\u2014at early morn he paints,\nAnd all day long, and, when night comes, the lamp\nLights up his studious forehead and thin hands\u2014\nSo delicately prick'd the sign appear'd\nOn Sohrab's arm, the sign of Rustum's seal.\n\nIt was that griffin, which of old rear'd Zal,\nRustum's great father, whom they left to die,\nA helpless babe, among the mountain-rocks;\nHim that kind creature found, and rear'd, and loved\u2014\nThen Rustum took it for his glorious sign.\n\nAnd Sohrab bared that image on his arm,\nAnd himself scann'd it long with mournful eyes,\nAnd then he touch'd it with his hand and said:\u2014\n\n\"How say'st thou?\n\nIs that sign the proper sign\nOf Rustum's son, or of some other man's?\n\n\nHe spoke; but Rustum gazed, and gazed, and stood\nSpeechless; and then he utter'd one sharp cry:\nO boy\u2014thy father!\u2014and his voice choked there.\n\nAnd then a dark cloud pass'd before his eyes,\nAnd his head swam, and he sank down to earth.\n\nBut Sohrab crawl'd to where he lay, and cast\nHis arms about his neck, and kiss'd his lips,\nAnd with fond faltering fingers stroked his cheeks,\nTrying to call him back to life; and life\nCame back to Rustum, and he oped his eyes,\nAnd they stood wide with horror; and he seized\nIn both his hands the dust which lay around,\nAnd threw it on his head, and smirch'd his hair,\u2014\nHis hair, and face, and beard, and glittering arms;\nAnd strong convulsive groanings shook his breast,\nAnd his sobs choked him; and he clutch'd his sword,\nTo draw it, and for ever let life out.\n\nBut Sohrab saw his thoughts, and held his hands\nAnd with a soothing voice he spake, and said:\u2014\n\n\"Father, forbear! for I but meet to-day\nThe doom which at my birth was written down\nIn Heaven, and thou art Heaven's unconscious hand.\n\nSurely my heart cried out that it was thou,\nWhen first I saw thee; and thy heart spoke too,\nI know it! but fate trod those promptings down\nUnder its iron heel; fate, fate engaged\nThe strife, and hurl'd me on my father's spear.\n\nBut let us speak no more of this! I find\nMy father; let me feel that I have found!\nCome, sit beside me on this sand, and take\nMy head betwixt thy hands, and kiss my cheeks,\nAnd wash them with thy tears, and say:My son!\nQuick! quick! for number'd are my sands of life,\nAnd swift; for like the lightning to this field\nI came, and like the wind I go away\u2014\nSudden, and swift, and like a passing wind.\n\nBut it was writ in Heaven that this should be.\n\n\nSo said he, and his voice released the heart\nOf Rustum, and his tears broke forth; he cast\nHis arms round his son's neck, and wept aloud,\nAnd kiss'd him.\n\nAnd awe fell on both the hosts,\nWhen they saw Rustum's grief; and Ruksh, the horse,\nWith his head bowing to the ground and mane\nSweeping the dust, came near, and in mute woe\nFirst to the one then to the other moved\nHis head, as if enquiring what their grief\nMight mean; and from his dark, compassionate eyes,\nThe big warm tears roll'd down, and caked the sand.\n\nBut Rustum chid him with stern voice, and said:\u2014\n\n\"Ruksh, now thou grievest; but, O Ruksh, thy feet\nShould first have rotted on their nimble joints,\nOr ere they brought thy master to this field!\"\n\nBut Sohrab look'd upon the horse and said;\u2014\n\"Is this, then, Ruksh?\n\nHow often, in past days\nMy mother told me of thee, thou brave steed,\nMy terrible father's terrible horse! and said,\nThat I should one day find thy lord and thee.\n\nCome, let me lay my hand upon thy mane!\nO Ruksh, thou art more fortunate than I;\nFor thou has gone where I shall never go,\nAnd snuff'd the breezes of my father's home.\n\nAnd thou hast trod the sands of Seistan,\nAnd seen the River of Helmund, and the Lake\nOf Zirrah; and the aged Zal himself\nHas often stroked thy neck, and given thee food,\nCorn in a golden platter soak'd with wine,\nAnd said;O Ruksh! bear Rustrum well!\u2014but I\nHave never known my grandsire's furrow'd face,\nNor seen his lofty house in Seistan,\nNor slaked my thirst at the clear Helmund stream;\nBut lodged among my father's foes, and seen\nAfrasiab's cities only, Samarcand,\nBokhara, and lone Khiva in the waste,\nAnd the black Toorkmun tents; and only drunk\nThe desert rivers, Moorghab and Tejend,\nKohik, and where the Kalmuks feed their sheep,\nThe northern Sir; and this great Oxus stream,\nThe yellow Oxus, by whose brink I die.\n\n\nThen, with a heavy groan, Rustum bewail'd:\u2014\n\"Oh, that its waves were flowing over me!\nOh, that I saw its grains of yellow silt\nRoll, tumbling in the current o'er my head!\"\n\nBut, with a grave mild voice, Sohrab replied:\u2014\n\"Desire not that, my father! thou must live.\n\nFor some are born to do great deeds, and live,\nAs some are born to be obscured, and die.\n\nDo thou the deeds I die too young to do,\nAnd reap a second glory in thine age;\nThou art my father, and thy gain is mine.\n\nBut come! thou seest this great host of men\nWhich follow me; I pray thee, slay not these!\nLet me entreat for them; what have they done?\n\nThey follow'd me, my hope, my fame, my star.\n\nLet them all cross the Oxus back in peace.\n\nBut me thou must bear hence, not send with them,\nBut carry me with thee to Seistan,\nAnd place me on a bed, and mourn for me,\nThou, and the snow-hair'd Zal, and all thy friends.\n\nAnd thou must lay me in that lovely earth,\nAnd heap a stately mound above my bones,\nAnd plant a far-seen pillar over all.\n\nThat so the passing horseman on the waste\nMay see my tomb a great way off, and cry:\nSohrab, the mighty Rustum's son, lies there,\nWhom his great father did in ignorance kill!\nAnd I be not forgotten in my grave.\n\n\nAnd, with a mournful voice, Rustum replied:\u2014\n\"Fear not! as thou hast said, Sohrab, my son,\nSo shall it be; for I will burn my tents,\nAnd quit the host, and bear thee hence with me,\nAnd carry thee away to Seistan,\nAnd place thee on a bed, and mourn for thee,\nWith the snow-headed Zal, and all my friends.\n\nAnd I will lay thee in the lovely earth,\nAnd heap a stately mound above thy bones,\nAnd plant a far-seen pillar over all,\nAnd men shall not forget thee in thy grave.\n\nAnd I will spare thy host; yea, let them go!\nLet them all cross the Oxus back in peace!\nWhat should I do with slaying any more?\n\nFor would that all whom I have ever slain\nMight be once more alive; my bitterest foes,\nAnd they who were call'd champions in their time,\nAnd through whose death I won that fame I have\u2014\nAnd I were nothing but a common man,\nA poor, mean soldier, and without renown,\nSo thou mightest live too, my son, my son!\nOr rather would that I, even I myself,\nMight now be lying on this bloody sand,\nNear death, and by an ignorant stroke of thine,\nNot thou of mine! and I might die, not thou;\nAnd I, not thou, be borne to Seistan;\nAnd Zal might weep above my grave, not thine;\nAnd say:O son, I weep thee not too sore,\nFor willingly, I know, thou met'st thine end!\nBut now in blood and battles was my youth,\nAnd full of blood and battles is my age,\nAnd I shall never end this life of blood.\n\n\nThen, at the point of death, Sohrab replied:\u2014\n\"A life of blood indeed, thou dreadful man!\nBut thou shalt yet have peace; only not now,\nNot yet! but thou shalt have it on that day,\nWhen thou shalt sail in a high-masted ship,\nThou and the other peers of Kai Khosroo,\nReturning home over the salt blue sea,\nFrom laying thy dear master in his grave.\n\n\nAnd Rustum gazed in Sohrab's face, and said:\u2014\n\"Soon be that day, my son, and deep that sea!\nTill then, if fate so wills, let me endure.\n\n\nHe spoke; and Sohrab smiled on him, and took\nThe spear, and drew it from his side, and eased\nHis wound's imperious anguish; but the blood\nCame welling from the open gash, and life\nFlow'd with the stream;\u2014all down his cold white side\nThe crimson torrent ran, dim now and soil'd,\nLike the soil'd tissue of white violets\nLeft, freshly gather'd, on their native bank,\nBy children whom their nurses call with haste\nIndoors from the sun's eye; his head droop'd low,\nHis limbs grew slack; motionless, white, he lay\u2014\nWhite, with eyes closed; only when heavy gasps,\nDeep heavy gasps quivering through all his frame,\nConvulsed him back to life, he open'd them,\nAnd fix'd them feebly on his father's face;\nTill now all strength was ebb'd, and from his limbs\nUnwillingly the spirit fled away,\nRegretting the warm mansion which it left,\nAnd youth, and bloom, and this delightful world.\n\nSo, on the bloody sand, Sohrab lay dead;\nAnd the great Rustum drew his horseman's cloak\nDown o'er his face, and sate by his dead son.\n\nAs those black granite pillars, once high-rear'd\nBy Jemshid in Persepolis, to bear\nHis house, now 'mid their broken flights of steps\nLie prone, enormous, down the mountain side\u2014\nSo in the sand lay Rustum by his son.\n\nAnd night came down over the solemn waste,\nAnd the two gazing hosts, and that sole pair,\nAnd darken'd all; and a cold fog, with night,\nCrept from the Oxus.\n\nSoon a hum arose,\nAs of a great assembly loosed, and fires\nBegan to twinkle through the fog; for now\nBoth armies moved to camp, and took their meal;\nThe Persians took it on the open sands\nSouthward, the Tartars by the river marge;\nAnd Rustum and his son were left alone.\n\nBut the majestic river floated on,\nOut of the mist and hum of that low land,\nInto the frosty starlight, and there moved,\nRejoicing, through the hush'd Chorasmian waste,\nUnder the solitary moon;\u2014he flow'd\nRight for the polar star, past Orgunj\u00e8,\nBrimming, and bright, and large; then sands begin\nTo hem his watery march, and dam his streams,\nAnd split his currents; that for many a league\nThe shorn and parcell'd Oxus strains along\nThrough beds of sand and matted rushy isles\u2014\nOxus, forgetting the bright speed he had\nIn his high mountain-cradle in Pamere,\nA foil'd circuitous wanderer\u2014till at last\nThe long'd-for dash of waves is heard, and wide\nHis luminous home of waters opens, bright\nAnd tranquil, from whose floor the new-bathed stars\nEmerge, and shine upon the Aral Sea.\n", "period": "Victorian", "literary_movement": "Romanticism", "register": "Epic", "rhetorical_genre": "Epideictic", "discursive_structure": "Exposition, Development, Closure", "discourse_type": "Expository", "narrative_level": "Third person omniscient", "diegetic_mimetic": "Mimetic", "focalization": "Omniscient", "person": "Third person", "deictic_orientation": "External", "addressee_type": "Implied", "deictic_object": "The reader", "temporal_orientation": "Past", "temporal_structure": "Linear", "tradition": "Classical", "mode": "Narrative", "genre": "Epic Poem", "stanza_structure": "Quatrains", "meter": "Iambic pentameter", "rhyme": "AABB"}

rush-bottoming chairs,\nHer hair, straight, shiny, coarse, black, profuse, half-envelop'd her\nface,\nHer step was free and elastic, and her voice sounded exquisitely as\nshe spoke.\n\nMy mother look'd in delight and amazement at the stranger,\nShe look'd at the freshness of her tall-borne face, and full and\npliant limbs,\nThe more she look'd upon her, she loved her,\nNever before had she seen such wonderful beauty and purity,\nShe made her sit on a bench by the jamb of the fireplace\u2014she cook'd\nfood for her,\nShe had no work to give her, but she gave her remembrance

precedents, have long been accumulating undirected materials,\nAmerica brings builders, and brings its own styles.\n\nThe immortal poets of Asia and Europe have done their work, and\npass'd to other spheres,\nA work remains, the work of surpassing all they have done.\n\nAmerica, curious toward foreign characters, stands by its own at all\nhazards,\nStands removed, spacious, composite, sound\u2014initiates the true use of\nprecedents,\nDoes not repel them, or the past, or what they have produced under\ntheir forms,\nTakes the lesson with calmness, perceives the corpse slowly borne\nfrom the house,\nPerceives that it waits a little while in the door\u2014that it was\nfittest for its days,\nThat its life has descended to the stalwart and well-shaped heir who\napproaches,\nAnd that he shall be fittest for his days.\n\nAny period, one nation must lead,\nOne land must be the promise and reliance of the future.\n\nThese States are the amplest poem,\nHere is not merely a nation, but a teeming nation of nations,\nHere the doings of men correspond with the broadcast doings of the\nday and night,\nHere is what moves in magnificent masses, careless of particulars,\nHere are the roughs, beards, friendliness, combativeness, the Soul\nloves,\nHere the flowing trains\u2014here the crowds, equality, diversity, the\nSoul loves.\n\nLand of lands, and bards to corroborate!\nOf them, standing among them, one lifts to the light his west-bred\nface,\nTo him the hereditary countenance bequeath'd, both mother's and\nfather's,\nHis first parts substances, earth, water, animals, trees,\nBuilt of the common stock, having room for far and near,\nUsed to dispense with other lands, incarnating this land,\nAttracting it Body and Soul to himself, hanging on its neck with\nincomparable love,\nPlunging his seminal muscle into its merits and demerits,\nMaking its cities, beginnings, events, diversities, wars, vocal in\nhim,\nMaking its rivers, lakes, bays, embouchure in him,\nMississippi with yearly freshets and changing chutes\u2014Columbia,\nNiagara, Hudson, spending themselves lovingly in him,\nIf the Atlantic coast stretch, or the Pacific coast stretch, he\nstretching with them north or south,\nSpanning between them, east and west, and touching whatever is\nbetween them,\nGrowths growing from him to offset the growth of pine, cedar,\nhemlock, live-oak, locust, chestnut, hickory, cottonwood,\norange, magnolia,\nTangles as tangled in him as any cane-brake or swamp,\nHe likening sides and peaks of mountains, forests coated with\nnorthern transparent ice,\nOff him pasturage, sweet and natural as savanna, upland, prairie,\nThrough him flights, whirls, screams, answering those of the fish-\nhawk, mocking-bird, night-heron, and eagle;\nHis spirit surrounding his country's spirit, unclosed to good and\nevil,\nSurrounding the essences of real things, old times and present times,\nSurrounding just found shores, islands, tribes of red aborigines,\nWeather-beaten vessels, landings, settlements, embryo stature and\nmuscle,\nThe haughty defiance of the Year 1\u2014war, peace, the formation of the\nConstitution,\nThe separate States, the simple, elastic scheme, the immigrants,\nThe Union, always swarming with blatherers, and always sure and\nimpregnable,\nThe unsurvey'd interior, log-houses, clearings, wild animals,\nhunters, trappers;\nSurrounding the multiform agriculture, mines, temperature, the\ngestation of new States,\nCongress convening every Twelfth-month, the members duly coming up\nfrom the uttermost parts;\nSurrounding the noble character of mechanics and farmers, especially\nthe young men,\nResponding their manners, speech, dress, friendships\u2014the gait they\nhave of persons who never knew how it felt to stand in the\npresence of superiors,\nThe freshness and candor of their physiognomy, the copiousness and\ndecision of their phrenology,\nThe picturesque looseness of their carriage, their fierceness when\nwrong'd,\nThe fluency of their speech, their delight in music, their curiosity,\ngood temper, and open-handedness\u2014the whole composite make,\nThe prevailing ardor and enterprise, the large amativeness,\nThe perfect equality of the female with the male, the fluid movement\nof the population,\nThe superior marine, free commerce, fisheries, whaling, gold-digging,\nWharf-hemm'd cities, railroad and steamboat lines, intersecting all\npoints,\nFactories, mercantile life, labor-saving machinery, the north-east,\nnorth-west, south-west,\nManhattan firemen, the Yankee swap, southern plantation life,\nSlavery\u2014the murderous, treacherous conspiracy to raise it upon the\nruins of all the rest;\nOn and on to the grapple with it\u2014Assassin!

of soft astral, but dazzling and fierce,\nWith war's flames, and the lambent lightnings playing,\nAnd your port immovable where you stand;\nWith still the inextinguishable glance, and the clench'd and lifted\nfist,\nAnd your foot on the neck of the menacing one, the scorner, utterly\ncrush'd beneath you;\nThe menacing, arrogant one, that strode and advanced with his\nsenseless scorn, bearing the murderous knife;\n\u2014Lo! the wide swelling one, the braggart, that would yesterday do so\nmuch!\nTo-day a carrion dead and damn'd, the despised of all the earth!\nAn offal rank, to the dunghill

and grand\u2014by them alone can The States be fused\ninto the compact organism of a Nation.\n\nTo hold men together by paper and seal, or by compulsion, is no\naccount;\nThat only holds men together

from him, things are grotesque, eccentric, fail\nof their full returns,\nNothing out of its place is good, nothing in its place is bad,\nHe bestows on every object or quality its fit proportion, neither\nmore nor less,\nHe is the arbiter of the diverse, he is the key,\nHe is the equalizer of his age and land,\nHe supplies what wants supplying\u2014he checks what wants checking,\nIn peace, out of him speaks the spirit of peace, large, rich,\nthrifty, building populous towns, encouraging agriculture,\narts, commerce, lighting the study of man, the Soul, health,\nimmortality, government;\nIn war, he is the best backer of the war\u2014he fetches artillery as\ngood as the engineer's\u2014he can make every word he speaks draw\nblood;\nThe years straying toward infidelity, he withholds by his steady\nfaith,\nHe is no argurer, he is judgment\u2014(Nature accepts him absolutely\nHe judges not as the judge judges, but as the sun falling round a\nhelpless thing;\nAs he sees the farthest, he has the most faith,\nHis thoughts are the hymns of the praise of things,\nIn the dispute on God and eternity he is silent,\nHe sees eternity less like a play with a prologue and denouement,\nHe sees

said\nShall these bones live?\n\nshall these\nBones live?\n\nAnd that which had been contained\nIn the bones (which were already dry) said chirping:\nBecause of the goodness of this Lady\nAnd because of her loveliness, and because\nShe honours the Virgin in meditation,\nWe shine with brightness.\n\nAnd I who am here dissembled\nProffer my deeds to oblivion, and my love\nTo the posterity of the desert and the fruit of the gourd.\n\nIt is this which recovers\nMy guts the strings of my eyes and the indigestible portions\nWhich the leopards reject.\n\nThe Lady is withdrawn\nIn a white gown, to contemplation, in a white gown.\n\nLet the whiteness of bones atone to forgetfulness.\n\nThere is no life in them.\n\nAs I am forgotten\nAnd would be forgotten, so I would forget\nThus devoted, concentrated in purpose.\n\nAnd God said\nProphesy to the wind, to the wind only for only\nThe wind will listen.\n\nAnd the bones sang chirping\nWith the burden of the grasshopper, saying\nLady of silences\nCalm and distressed\nTorn and most whole\nRose of memory\nRose of forgetfulness\nExhausted and life-giving\nWorried reposeful\nThe single Rose\nIs now the Garden\nWhere all loves end\nTerminate torment\nOf love unsatisfied\nThe greater torment\nOf love satisfied\nEnd of the endless\nJourney to no end\nConclusion of all that\nIs inconclusible\nSpeech without word and\nWord of no speech\nGrace to the Mother\nFor the Garden\nWhere all love ends.\n\nUnder a juniper-tree the bones sang, scattered and shining\nWe are glad to be scattered, we did little good to each other,\nUnder a tree in the cool of day, with the blessing of sand,\nForgetting themselves and each other, united\nIn the quiet of the desert.\n\nThis is the land which ye\nShall divide by lot.\n\nAnd neither division nor unity\nMatters.\n\nThis is the land.\n\nWe have our inheritance.\n\nIII\nAt the first turning of the second stair\nI turned and saw below\nThe same shape twisted on the banister\nUnder the vapour in the fetid air\nStruggling with the devil of the stairs who wears\nThe deceitul face of hope and of despair.\n\nAt the second turning of the second stair\nI left them twisting, turning below;\nThere were no more faces and the stair was dark,\nDamp, jagg\u00e8d, like an old man's mouth drivelling, beyond repair,\nOr the toothed gullet of an ag\u00e8d shark.\n\nAt the first turning of the third stair\nWas a slotted window bellied like the figs's fruit\nAnd beyond the hawthorn blossom and a pasture scene\nThe broadbacked figure drest in blue and green\nEnchanted the maytime with an antique flute.\n\nBlown hair is sweet, brown hair over the mouth blown,\nLilac and brown hair;\nDistraction, music of the flute, stops and steps of the mind\nover the third stair,\nFading, fading; strength beyond hope and despair\nClimbing the third stair.\n\nLord, I am not worthy\nLord, I am not worthy\nbut speak the word only.\n\nIV\nWho walked between the violet and the violet\nWho walked between\nThe various ranks of varied green\nGoing in white and blue, in Mary's colour,\nTalking of trivial things\nIn ignorance and knowledge of eternal dolour\nWho moved among the others as they walked,\nWho then made strong the fountains and made fresh the springs\nMade cool the dry rock and made firm the sand\nIn blue of larkspur, blue of Mary's colour,\nSovegna vos\nHere are the years that walk between, bearing\nAway the fiddles and the flutes, restoring\nOne who moves in the time between sleep and waking, wearing\nWhite light folded, sheathing about her, folded.\n\nThe new years walk, restoring\nThrough a bright cloud of tears, the years, restoring\nWith a new verse the ancient rhyme.\n\nRedeem\nThe time.\n\nRedeem\nThe unread vision in the higher dream\nWhile jewelled unicorns draw by the gilded hearse.\n\nThe silent sister veiled in white and blue\nBetween the yews, behind the garden god,\nWhose flute is breathless, bent her head and signed but spoke no word\nBut the fountain sprang up and the bird sang down\nRedeem the time, redeem the dream\nThe token of the word unheard, unspoken\nTill the wind shake a thousand whispers from the yew\nAnd after this our exile\nV\nIf the lost word is lost, if the spent word is spent\nIf the unheard, unspoken\nWord is unspoken, unheard;\nStill is the unspoken word, the Word unheard,\nThe Word without a word, the Word within\nThe world and for the world;\nAnd the light shone in darkness and\nAgainst the Word the unstilled world still whirled\nAbout the centre of the silent Word.\n\nO my people, what have I done unto thee.\n\nWhere shall the word be found, where will the word\nResound?\n\nNot here, there is not enough silence\nNot on the sea or on the islands, not\nOn the mainland, in the desert or the rain land,\nFor those who walk in darkness\nBoth in the day time and in the night time\nThe right time and the right place are not here\nNo place of grace for those who avoid the face\nNo time to rejoice for those who walk among noise and deny the voice\nWill the veiled sister pray for\nThose who walk in darkness, who chose thee and oppose thee,\nThose who are torn on the horn between season and season, time and time, between\nHour and hour, word and word, power and power, those who wait\nIn darkness?\n\nWill the veiled sister pray\nFor children at the gate\nWho will not go away and cannot pray:\nPray for those who chose and oppose\nO my people, what have I done unto thee.\n\nWill the veiled sister between the slender\nYew trees pray for those who offend her\nAnd are terrified and cannot surrender\nAnd affirm before the world and deny between the rocks\nIn the last desert before the last blue rocks\nThe desert in the garden the garden in the desert\nOf drouth, spitting from the mouth the withered apple-seed.\n\nO my people.\n\nVI\nAlthough I do not hope to turn again\nAlthough I do not hope\nAlthough I do not hope to turn\nWavering between the profit and the loss\nIn this brief transit where the dreams cross\nThe dreamcrossed twilight between birth and dying\n(Bless me father) though I do not wish to wish these things\nFrom the wide window towards the granite shore\nThe white sails still fly seaward, seaward flying\nUnbroken wings\nAnd the lost heart stiffens and rejoices\nIn the lost lilac and the lost sea voices\nAnd the weak spirit quickens to rebel\nFor the bent golden-rod and the lost sea smell\nQuickens to recover\nThe cry of quail and the whirling plover\nAnd the blind eye creates\nThe empty forms between the ivory gates\nAnd smell renews the salt savour of the sandy earth\nThis is the time of tension between dying and birth\nThe place of solitude where three dreams cross\nBetween blue rocks\nBut when the voices shaken from the yew-tree drift away\nLet the other yew be shaken and reply.\n\nBless\u00e8d sister, holy mother, spirit of the fountain, spirit of the garden,\nSuffer us not to mock ourselves with falsehood\nTeach us to care and not to care\nTeach us to sit still\nEven among these rocks,\nOur peace in His will\nAnd even among these rocks\nSister, mother\nAnd spirit of the river, spirit of the sea,\nSuffer me not to be separated\nAnd let my cry come unto Thee.\n", "period": "Modernist", "literary_movement": "Modernism", "register": "Formal", "rhetorical_genre": "Epideictic", "discursive_structure":

branches, dark in the afternoon,\nWhere you lean against a bank while a van passes,\nAnd the deep lane insists on the direction\nInto the village, in the electric heat\nHypnotised.\n\nIn a warm haze the sultry light\nIs absorbed, not refracted, by grey stone.\n\nThe dahlias sleep in the empty silence.\n\nWait for the early owl.\n\nIn that open field\nIf you do not come too close, if you do not come too close,\nOn a summer midnight, you can hear the music\nOf the weak pipe and the little drum\nAnd see them dancing around the bonfire\nThe association of man and woman\nIn daunsinge, signifying matrimonie\u2014\nA dignified and commodiois sacrament.\n\nTwo and two, necessarye coniunction,\nHolding eche other by the hand or the arm\nWhiche betokeneth concorde.\n\nRound and round the fire\nLeaping through the flames, or joined in circles,\nRustically solemn or in rustic laughter\nLifting heavy feet in clumsy shoes,\nEarth feet, loam feet, lifted in country mirth\nMirth of those long since under earth\nNourishing the corn.\n\nKeeping time,\nKeeping the rhythm in their dancing\nAs in their living in the living seasons\nThe time of the seasons and the constellations\nThe time of milking and the time of harvest\nThe time of the coupling of man and woman\nAnd that of beasts.\n\nFeet rising and falling.\n\nEating and drinking.\n\nDung and death.\n\nDawn points, and another day\nPrepares for heat and silence.\n\nOut at sea the dawn wind\nWrinkles and slides.\n\nI am here\nOr there, or elsewhere.\n\nIn my beginning.\n\nII\nWhat is the late November doing\nWith the disturbance of the spring\nAnd creatures of the summer heat,\nAnd snowdrops writhing under feet\nAnd hollyhocks that aim too high\nRed into grey and tumble down\nLate roses filled with early snow?\n\nThunder rolled by the rolling stars\nSimulates triumphal cars\nDeployed in constellated wars\nScorpion fights against the Sun\nUntil the Sun and Moon go down\nComets weep and Leonids fly\nHunt the heavens and the plains\nWhirled in a vortex that shall bring\nThe world to that destructive fire\nWhich burns before the ice-cap reigns.\n\nThat was a way of putting it\u2014not very satisfactory:\nA periphrastic study in a worn-out poetical fashion,\nLeaving one still with the intolerable wrestle\nWith words and meanings.\n\nThe poetry does not matter.\n\nIt was not (to start again) what one had expected.\n\nWhat was to be the value of the long looked forward to,\nLong hoped for calm, the autumnal serenity\nAnd the wisdom of age?\n\nHad they deceived us\nOr deceived themselves, the quiet-voiced elders,\nBequeathing us merely a receipt for deceit?\n\nThe serenity only a deliberate hebetude,\nThe wisdom only the knowledge of dead secrets\nUseless in the darkness into which they peered\nOr from which they turned their eyes.\n\nThere is, it seems to us,\nAt best, only a limited value\nIn the knowledge derived from experience.\n\nThe knowledge imposes a pattern, and falsifies,\nFor the pattern is new in every moment\nAnd every moment is a new and shocking\nValuation of all we have been.\n\nWe are only undeceived\nOf that which, deceiving, could no longer harm.\n\nIn the middle, not only in the middle of the way\nBut all the way, in a dark wood, in a bramble,\nOn the edge of a grimpen, where is no secure foothold,\nAnd menaced by monsters, fancy lights,\nRisking enchantment.\n\nDo not let me hear\nOf the wisdom of old men, but rather of their folly,\nTheir fear of fear and frenzy, their fear of possession,\nOf belonging to another, or to others, or to God.\n\nThe only wisdom we can hope to acquire\nIs the wisdom of humility: humility is endless.\n\nThe houses are all gone under the sea.\n\nThe dancers are all gone under the hill.\n\nIII\nO dark dark dark.\n\nThey all go into the dark,\nThe vacant interstellar spaces, the vacant into the vacant,\nThe captains, merchant bankers, eminent men of letters,\nThe generous patrons of art, the statesmen and the rulers,\nDistinguished civil servants, chairmen of many committees,\nIndustrial lords and petty contractors, all go into the dark,\nAnd dark the Sun and Moon, and the Almanach de Gotha\nAnd the Stock Exchange Gazette, the Directory of Directors,\nAnd cold the sense and lost the motive of action.\n\nAnd we all go with them, into the silent funeral,\nNobody's funeral, for there is no one to bury.\n\nI said to my soul, be still, and let the dark come upon you\nWhich shall be the darkness of God.\n\nAs, in a theatre,\nThe lights are extinguished, for the scene to be changed\nWith a hollow rumble of wings, with a movement of darkness on darkness,\nAnd we know that the hills and the trees, the distant panorama\nAnd the bold imposing fa\u00e7ade are all being rolled away\u2014\nOr as, when an underground train, in the tube, stops too long between stations\nAnd the conversation rises and slowly fades into silence\nAnd you see behind every face the mental emptiness deepen\nLeaving only the growing terror of nothing to think about;\nOr when, under ether, the mind is conscious but conscious of nothing\u2014\nI said to my soul, be still, and wait without hope\nFor hope would be hope for the wrong thing; wait without love,\nFor love would be love of the wrong thing; there is yet faith\nBut the faith and the love and the hope are all in the waiting.\n\nWait without thought, for you are not ready for thought:\nSo the darkness shall be the light, and the stillness the dancing.\n\nWhisper of running streams, and winter lightning.\n\nThe wild thyme unseen and the wild strawberry,\nThe laughter in the garden, echoed ecstasy\nNot lost, but requiring, pointing to the agony\nOf death and birth.\n\nYou say I am repeating\nSomething I have said before.\n\nI shall say it again.\n\nShall I say it again?\n\nIn order to arrive there,\nTo arrive where you are, to get from where you are not,\nYou must go by a way wherein there is no ecstasy.\n\nIn order to arrive at what you do not know\nYou must go by a way which is the way of ignorance.\n\nIn order to possess what you do not possess\nYou must go by the way of dispossession.\n\nIn order to arrive at what you are not\nYou must go through the way in which you are not.\n\nAnd what you do not know is the only thing you know\nAnd what you own is what you do not own\nAnd where you are is where you are not.\n\nIV\nThe wounded surgeon plies the steel\nThat questions the distempered part;\nBeneath the bleeding hands we feel\nThe sharp compassion of the healer's art\nResolving the enigma of the fever chart.\n\nOur only health is the disease\nIf we obey the dying nurse\nWhose constant care is not to please\nBut to remind of our, and Adam's curse,\nAnd that, to be restored, our sickness must grow worse.\n\nThe whole earth is our hospital\nEndowed by the ruined millionaire,\nWherein, if we do well, we shall\nDie of the absolute paternal care\nThat will not leave us, but prevents us everywhere.\n\nThe chill ascends from feet to knees,\nThe fever sings in mental wires.\n\nIf to be warmed, then I must freeze\nAnd quake in frigid purgatorial fires\nOf which the flame is roses, and the smoke is briars.\n\nThe dripping blood our only drink,\nThe bloody flesh our only food:\nIn spite of which we like to think\nThat we are sound, substantial flesh and blood\u2014\nAgain, in spite of that, we call this Friday good.\n\nV\nSo here I am, in the middle way, having had twenty years\u2014\nTwenty years largely wasted, the years of l'entre deux guerres\nTrying to use words, and every attempt\nIs a wholly new start, and a different kind of failure\nBecause one has only learnt to get the better of words\nFor the thing one no longer has to say, or the way in which\nOne is no longer disposed to say it.\n\nAnd so each venture\nIs a new beginning, a raid on the inarticulate\nWith shabby equipment always deteriorating\nIn the general mess of imprecision of feeling,\nUndisciplined squads of emotion.\n\nAnd what there is to conquer\nBy strength and submission, has already been discovered\nOnce or twice, or several times, by men whom one cannot hope\nTo emulate\u2014but there is no competition\u2014\nThere is only the fight to recover what has been lost\nAnd found and lost again and again: and now, under conditions\nThat seem unpropitious.\n\nBut perhaps neither gain nor loss.\n\nFor us, there is only the trying.\n\nThe rest is not our business.\n\nHome is where one starts from.\n\nAs we grow older\nThe world becomes stranger, the pattern more complicated\nOf dead and living.\n\nNot the intense moment\nIsolated, with no before and after,\nBut a lifetime burning in every moment\nAnd not the lifetime of one man only\nBut of old stones that cannot be deciphered.\n\nThere is a time for the evening under starlight,\nA time for the evening under lamplight\n(The evening with the photograph album).\n\nLove is most nearly itself\nWhen here and now cease to matter.\n\nOld men ought to be explorers\nHere or there does not matter\nWe must be still and still moving\nInto another intensity\nFor a further union, a deeper communion\nThrough the dark cold and the empty desolation,\nThe wave cry, the wind cry, the vast waters\nOf the petrel and the porpoise.\n\nIn my end is my beginning.", "period": "Modernist",

for Warren.\n\nWhen she heard his step,\nShe ran on tip-toe down the darkened passage\nTo meet him in the doorway with the news\nAnd put him on his guard.\n\n\u2018Silas is back.\n\nShe pushed him outward with her through the door\nAnd shut it after her.\n\n\u2018Be kind,\u2019 she said.\n\nShe took the market things from Warren\u2019s arms\nAnd set them on the porch, then drew him down\nTo sit beside her on the wooden steps.\n\n\u2018When was I ever anything but kind to him?\n\nBut I\u2019ll not have the fellow back,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018I told him so last haying, didn\u2019t I?\n\nIf he left then, I said, that ended it.\n\nWhat good is he?\n\nWho else will harbor him\nAt his age for the little he can do?\n\nWhat help he is there\u2019s no depending on.\n\nOff he goes always when I need him most.\n\nHe thinks he ought to earn a little pay,\nEnough at least to buy tobacco with,\nSo he won\u2019t have to beg and be beholden.\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d I say, \u201cI can\u2019t afford to pay\nAny fixed wages, though I wish I could.\n\n\u201cSomeone else can.\n\n\u201d \u201cThen someone else will have to.\n\nI shouldn\u2019t mind his bettering himself\nIf that was what it was.\n\nYou can be certain,\nWhen he begins like that, there\u2019s someone at him\nTrying to coax him off with pocket-money,\u2014\nIn haying time, when any help is scarce.\n\nIn winter he comes back to us.\n\nI\u2019m done.\n\n\n\u2018Sh! not so loud: he\u2019ll hear you,\u2019 Mary said.\n\n\u2018I want him to: he\u2019ll have to soon or late.\n\n\n\u2018He\u2019s worn out.\n\nHe\u2019s asleep beside the stove.\n\nWhen I came up from Rowe\u2019s I found him here,\nHuddled against the barn-door fast asleep,\nA miserable sight, and frightening, too\u2014\nYou needn\u2019t smile\u2014I didn\u2019t recognize him\u2014\nI wasn\u2019t looking for him\u2014and he\u2019s changed.\n\nWait till you see.\n\n\n\u2018Where did you say he\u2019d been?\n\n\n\u2018He didn\u2019t say.\n\nI dragged him to the house,\nAnd gave him tea and tried to make him smoke.\n\nI tried to make him talk about his travels.\n\nNothing would do: he just kept nodding off.\n\n\n\u2018What did he say?\n\nDid he say anything?\n\n\n\u2018But little.\n\n\n\u2018Anything?\n\nMary, confess\nHe said he\u2019d come to ditch the meadow for me.\n\n\n\u2018Warren!\u2019\n\n\u2018But did he?\n\nI just want to know.\n\n\n\u2018Of course he did.\n\nWhat would you have him say?\n\nSurely you wouldn\u2019t grudge the poor old man\nSome humble way to save his self-respect.\n\nHe added, if you really care to know,\nHe meant to clear the upper pasture, too.\n\nThat sounds like something you have heard before?\n\nWarren, I wish you could have heard the way\nHe jumbled everything.\n\nI stopped to look\nTwo or three times\u2014he made me feel so queer\u2014\nTo see if he was talking in his sleep.\n\nHe ran on Harold Wilson\u2014you remember\u2014\nThe boy you had in haying four years since.\n\nHe\u2019s finished school, and teaching in his college.\n\nSilas declares you\u2019ll have to get him back.\n\nHe says they two will make a team for work:\nBetween them they will lay this farm as smooth!\nThe way he mixed that in with other things.\n\nHe thinks young Wilson a likely lad, though daft\nOn education\u2014you know how they fought\nAll through July under the blazing sun,\nSilas up on the cart to build the load,\nHarold along beside to pitch it on.\n\n\n\u2018Yes, I took care to keep well out of earshot.\n\n\n\u2018Well, those days trouble Silas like a dream.\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t think they would.\n\nHow some things linger!\nHarold\u2019s young college boy\u2019s assurance piqued him.\n\nAfter so many years he still keeps finding\nGood arguments he sees he might have used.\n\nI sympathize.\n\nI know just how it feels\nTo think of the right thing to say too late.\n\nHarold\u2019s associated in his mind with Latin.\n\nHe asked me what I thought of Harold\u2019s saying\nHe studied Latin like the violin\nBecause he liked it\u2014that an argument!\nHe said he couldn\u2019t make the boy believe\nHe could find water with a hazel prong\u2014\nWhich showed how much good school had ever done him.\n\nHe wanted to go over that.\n\nBut most of all\nHe thinks if he could have another chance\nTo teach him how to build a load of hay\u2014\u2019\n\n\u2018I know, that\u2019s Silas\u2019 one accomplishment.\n\nHe bundles every forkful in its place,\nAnd tags and numbers it for future reference,\nSo he can find and easily dislodge it\nIn the unloading.\n\nSilas does that well.\n\nHe takes it out in bunches like big birds\u2019 nests.\n\nYou never see him standing on the hay\nHe\u2019s trying to lift, straining to lift himself.\n\n\n\u2018He thinks if he could teach him that, he\u2019d be\nSome good perhaps to someone in the world.\n\nHe hates to see a boy the fool of books.\n\nPoor Silas, so concerned for other folk,\nAnd nothing to look backward to with pride,\nAnd nothing to look forward to with hope,\nSo now and never any different.\n\n\nPart of a moon was falling down the west,\nDragging the whole sky with it to the hills.\n\nIts light poured softly in her lap.\n\nShe saw it\nAnd spread her apron to it.\n\nShe put out her hand\nAmong the harp-like morning-glory strings,\nTaut with the dew from garden bed to eaves,\nAs if she played unheard some tenderness\nThat wrought on him beside her in the night.\n\n\u2018Warren,\u2019 she said, \u2018he has come home to die:\nYou needn\u2019t be afraid he\u2019ll leave you this time.\n\n\n\u2018Home,\u2019 he mocked gently.\n\n\u2018Yes, what else but home?\n\nIt all depends on what you mean by home.\n\nOf course he\u2019s nothing to us, any more\nThan was the hound that came a stranger to us\nOut of the woods, worn out upon the trail.\n\n\n\u2018Home is the place where, when you have to go there,\nThey have to take you in.\n\n\n\u2018I should have called it\nSomething you somehow haven\u2019t to deserve.\n\n\nWarren leaned out and took a step or two,\nPicked up a little stick, and brought it back\nAnd broke it in his hand and tossed it by.\n\n\u2018Silas has better claim on us you think\nThan on his brother?\n\nThirteen little miles\nAs the road winds would bring him to his door.\n\nSilas has walked that far no doubt today.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t he go there?\n\nHis brother\u2019s rich,\nA somebody\u2014director in the bank.\n\n\n\u2018He never told us that.\n\n\n\u2018We know it though.\n\n\n\u2018I think his brother ought to help, of course.\n\nI\u2019ll see to that if there is need.\n\nHe ought of right\nTo take him in, and might be willing to\u2014\nHe may be better than appearances.\n\nBut have some pity on Silas.\n\nDo you think\nIf he\u2019d had any pride in claiming kin\nOr anything he looked for from his brother,\nHe\u2019d keep so still about him all this time?\n\n\n\u2018I wonder what\u2019s between them.\n\n\n\u2018I can tell you.\n\nSilas is what he is\u2014we wouldn\u2019t mind him\u2014\nBut just the kind that kinsfolk can\u2019t abide.\n\nHe never did a thing so very bad.\n\nHe don\u2019t know why he isn\u2019t quite as good\nAs anyone.\n\nWorthless though he is,\nHe won\u2019t be made ashamed to please his brother.\n\n\n\u2018Ican\u2019t think Si ever hurt anyone.\n\n\n\u2018No, but he hurt my heart the way he lay\nAnd rolled his old head on that sharp-edged chair-back.\n\nHe wouldn\u2019t let me put him on the lounge.\n\nYou must go in and see what you can do.\n\nI made the bed up for him there tonight.\n\nYou\u2019ll be surprised at him\u2014how much he\u2019s broken.\n\nHis working days are done; I'm sure of it.\n\n\n\u2018I\u2019d not be in a hurry to say that.\n\n\n\u2018I haven\u2019t been.\n\nGo, look, see for yourself.\n\nBut, Warren, please remember how it is:\nHe\u2019s come to help you ditch the meadow.\n\nHe has a plan.\n\nYou mustn\u2019t laugh at him.\n\nHe may not speak of it, and then he may.\n\nI\u2019ll sit and see if that small sailing cloud\nWill hit or miss the moon.\n\n\nIt hit the moon.\n\nThen there were three there, making a dim row,\nThe moon, the little silver cloud, and she.\n\nWarren returned\u2014too soon, it seemed to her,\nSlipped to her side, caught up her hand and waited.\n\n\u2018Warren,\u2019 she questioned.\n\n\u2018Dead,\u2019 was all he answered.\n", "period": "Modernist", "literary_movement": "Modernism", "register": "Narrative", "rhetorical_genre": "Epideictic",

sorts.\n\nThe day was green.\n\nThey said, 'You have a blue guitar,\nYou do not play things as they are.\n\nThe man replied, 'Things as they are\nAre changed upon the blue guitar.\n\nAnd they said then, 'But play, you must,\nA tune beyond us, yet ourselves,\nA tune upon the blue guitar\nOf things exactly as they are.\n\nII\nI cannot bring a world quite round,\nAlthough I patch it as I can.\n\nI sing a hero's head, large eye\nAnd bearded bronze, but not a man,\nAlthough I patch him as I can\nAnd reach through him almost to man.\n\nIf to serenade almost to man\nIs to miss, by that, things as they are,\nSay it is the serenade\nOf a man that plays a blue guitar.\n\nIII\nAh, but to play man number one,\nTo drive the dagger in his heart,\nTo lay his brain upon the board\nAnd pick the acrid colors out,\nTo nail his thought across the door,\nIts wings spread wide to rain and snow,\nTo strike his living hi and ho,\nTo tick it, tock it, turn it true,\nTo bang from it a savage blue,\nJangling the metal of the strings\nIV\nSo that's life, then: things as they are?\n\nIt picks its way on the blue guitar.\n\nA million people on one string?\n\nAnd all their manner in the thing,\nAnd all their manner, right and wrong,\nAnd all their manner, weak and strong?\n\nThe feelings crazily, craftily call,\nLike a buzzing of flies in autumn air,\nAnd that's life, then: things as they are,\nThis buzzing of the blue guitar.\n\nV\nDo not speak to us of the greatness of poetry,\nOf the torches wisping in the underground,\nOf the structure of vaults upon a point of light.\n\nThere are no shadows in our sun,\nDay is desire and night is sleep.\n\nThere are no shadows anywhere.\n\nThe earth, for us, is flat and bare.\n\nThere are no shadows.\n\nPoetry\nExceeding music must take the place\nOf empty heaven and its hymns,\nOurselves in poetry must take their place,\nEven in the chattering of your guitar.\n\nVI\nA tune beyond us as we are,\nYet nothing changed by the blue guitar;\nOurselves in the tune as if in space,\nYet nothing changed, except the place\nOf things as they are and only the place\nAs you play them, on the blue guitar,\nPlaced, so, beyond the compass of change,\nPerceived in a final atmosphere;\nFor a moment final, in the way\nThe thinking of art seems final when\nThe thinking of god is smoky dew.\n\nThe tune is space.\n\nThe blue guitar\nBecomes the place of things as they are,\nA composing of senses of the guitar.\n\nVII\nIt is the sun that shares our works.\n\nThe moon shares nothing.\n\nIt is a sea.\n\nWhen shall I come to say of the sun,\nIt is a sea; it shares nothing;\nThe sun no longer shares our works\nAnd the earth is alive with creeping men,\nMechanical beetles never quite warm?\n\nAnd shall I then stand in the sun, as now\nI stand in the moon, and call it good,\nThe immaculate, the merciful good,\nDetached from us, from things as they are?\n\nNot to be part of the sun?\n\nTo stand\nRemote and call it merciful?\n\nThe strings are cold on the blue guitar.\n\nVIII\nThe vivid, florid, turgid sky,\nThe drenching thunder rolling by,\nThe morning deluged still by night,\nThe clouds tumultuously bright\nAnd the feeling heavy in cold chords\nStruggling toward impassioned choirs,\nCrying among the clouds, enraged\nBy gold antagonists in air-\nI know my lazy, leaden twang\nIs like the reason in a storm;\nAnd yet it brings the storm to bear.\n\nI twang it out and leave it there.\n\nIX\nAnd the color, the overcast blue\nOf the air, in which the blue guitar\nIs a form, described but difficult,\nAnd I am merely a shadow hunched\nAbove the arrowy, still strings,\nThe maker of a thing yet to be made;\nThe color like a thought that grows\nOut of a mood, the tragic robe\nOf the actor, half his gesture, half\nHis speech, the dress of his meaning, silk\nSodden with his melancholy words,\nThe weather of his stage, himself.\n\nX\nRaise reddest columns.\n\nToll a bell\nAnd clap the hollows full of tin.\n\nThrow papers in the streets, the wills\nOf the dead, majestic in their seals.\n\nAnd the beautiful trombones-behold\nThe approach of him whom none believes,\nWhom all believe that all believe,\nA pagan in a varnished care.\n\nRoll a drum upon the blue guitar.\n\nLean from the steeple.\n\nCry aloud,\n'Here am I, my adversary, that\nConfront you, hoo-ing the slick trombones,\nYet with a petty misery\nAt heart, a petty misery,\nEver the prelude to your end,\nThe touch that topples men and rock.\n\nXV\nIs this picture of Picasso's, this 'hoard\nOf destructions', a picture of ourselves,\nNow, an image of our society?\n\nDo I sit, deformed, a naked egg,\nCatching at Good-bye, harvest moon,\nWithout seeing the harvest or the moon?\n\nThings as they are have been

be, is it mine?\n\nXXIII\nA few final solutions, like a duet\nWith the undertaker: a voice in the clouds,\nAnother on earth, the one a voice\nOf ether, the other smelling of drink,\nThe voice of ether prevailing, the swell\nOf the undertaker's song in the snow\nApostrophizing wreaths, the voice\nIn the clouds serene and final, next\nThe grunted breath scene and final,\nThe imagined and the real, thought\nAnd the truth, Dichtung und Wahrheit, all\nConfusion solved, as in a refrain\nOne keeps on playing year by year,\nConcerning the nature of things as they are.\n\nXXX\nFrom this I shall evolve a man.\n\nThis is his essence: the old fantoche\nHanging his shawl upon the wind,\nLike something on the stage, puffed out,\nHis strutting studied through centuries.\n\nAt last, in spite of his manner, his eye\nA-cock at the cross-piece on a pole\nSupporting heavy cables, slung\nThrough Oxidia, banal suburb,\nOne-half of all its installments paid.\n\nDew-dapper clapper-traps, blazing\nFrom crusty stacks above machines.\n\nEcce, Oxidia is the seed\nDropped out of this amber-ember pod,\nOxidia is the soot of fire,\nOxidia is Olympia.\n\nXXXI\nHow long and late the pheasant sleeps\nThe employer and employee contend,\nCombat, compose their droll affair.\n\nThe bubbling sun will bubble up,\nSpring sparkle and the cock-bird shriek.\n\nThe employer and employee will hear\nAnd continue their affair.\n\nThe shriek\nWill rack the thickets.\n\nThere is no place,\nHere, for the lark fixed in the mind,\nIn the museum of the sky.\n\nThe cock\nWill claw sleep.\n\nMorning is not sun,\nIt is this posture of the nerves,\nAs if a blunted player clutched\nThe nuances of the blue guitar.\n\nIt must be this rhapsody or none,\nThe rhapsody of things as they are.\n\nXXXII\nThrow away the lights, the definitions,\nAnd say of what you see in the dark\nThat it is this or that it is that,\nBut do not use the rotted names.\n\nHow should you walk in that space and know\nNothing of the madness of space,\nNothing of its jocular procreations?\n\nThrow the lights away.\n\nNothing must stand\nBetween you and the shapes you take\nWhen the crust of shape has been destroyed.\n\nYou as you are?\n\nYou are yourself.\n\nThe blue guitar surprises you.\n\nXXXIII\nThat generation's dream, aviled\nIn the mud, in Monday's dirty light,\nThat's it, the only dream they knew,\nTime in its final block, not time\nTo come, a wrangling of two dreams.\n\nHere is the bread of time to come,\nHere is its actual stone.\n\nThe bread\nWill be our bread, the stone will be\nOur bed and we shall sleep by

in flames.\n\nBut now he sits in quiet and green-a-day.\n\nHe assumes the great speeds of space and flutters them\nFrom cloud to cloudless, cloudless to keen clear\nIn flights of eye and ear, the highest eye\nAnd the lowest ear, the deep ear that discerns,\nAt evening, things that attend it until it hears\nThe supernatural preludes of its own,\nAt the moment when the angelic eye defines\nIts actors approaching, in company, in their masks.\n\nMaster O master seated by the fire\nAnd yet in space and motionless and yet\nOf motion the ever-brightening origin,\nProfound, and yet the king and yet the crown,\nLook at this present throne.\n\nWhat company,\nIn masks, can choir it with the naked wind?\n\nV\nThe mother invites humanity to her house\nAnd table.\n\nThe father fetches tellers of tales\nAnd musicians who mute much, muse much, on the tales.\n\nThe father fetches negresses to dance,\nAmong the children, like curious ripenesses\nOf pattern in the dance's ripening.\n\nFor these the musicians make insidious tones,\nClawing the sing-song of their instruments.\n\nThe children laugh and jangle a tinny time.\n\nThe father fetches pageants out of air,\nScenes of the theatre, vistas and blocks of woods\nAnd curtains like a naive pretence of sleep.\n\nAmong these the musicians strike the instinctive poem.\n\nThe father fetches his unherded herds,\nOf barbarous tongue, slavered and panting halves\nOf breath, obedient to his trumpet's touch.\n\nThis then is Chatillon or as you please.\n\nWe stand in the tumult of a festival.\n\nWhat festival?\n\nThis loud, disordered mooch?\n\nThese hospitaliers?\n\nThese brute-like guests?\n\nThese musicians dubbing at a tragedy,\nA-dub, a-dub, which is made up of this:\nThat there are no lines to speak?\n\nThere is no play.\n\nOr, the persons act one merely by being here.\n\nVI\nIt is a theatre floating through the clouds,\nItself a cloud, although of misted rock\nAnd mountains running like water, wave on wave,\nThrough waves of light.\n\nIt is of cloud transformed\nTo cloud transformed again, idly, the way\nA season changes color to no end,\nExcept the lavishing of itself in change,\nAs light changes yellow into gold and gold\nTo its opal elements and fire's delight,\nSplashed wide-wise because it likes magnificence\nAnd the solemn pleasures of magnificent space\nThe cloud drifts idly through half-thought-of forms.\n\nThe theatre is filled with flying birds,\nWild wedges, as of a volcano's smoke, palm-eyed\nAnd vanishing, a web in a corridor\nOr massive portico.\n\nA capitol,\nIt may be, is emerging or has just\nCollapsed.\n\nThe denouement has to be postponed .\n\n\nThis is nothing until in a single man contained,\nNothing until this named thing nameless is\nAnd is destroyed.\n\nHe opens the door of his house\nOn flames.\n\nThe scholar of one candle sees\nAn Arctic effulgence flaring on the frame\nOf everything he is.\n\nAnd he feels afraid.\n\nVII\nIs there an imagination that sits enthroned\nAs grim as it is benevolent, the just\nAnd the unjust, which in the midst of summer stops\nTo imagine winter?\n\nWhen the leaves are dead,\nDoes it take its place in the north and enfold itself,\nGoat-leaper, crystalled and luminous, sitting\nIn highest night?\n\nAnd do these heavens adorn\nAnd proclaim it, the white creator of black, jetted\nBy extinguishings, even of planets as may be,\nEven of earth, even of sight, in snow,\nExcept as needed by way of majesty,\nIn the sky, as crown and diamond cabala?\n\nIt leaps through us, through all our heavens leaps,\nExtinguishing our planets, one by one,\nLeaving, of where we were and looked, of where\nWe knew each other and of each other thought,\nA shivering residue, chilled and foregone,\nExcept for that crown and mystical cabala.\n\nBut it dare not leap by chance in its own dark.\n\nIt must change from destiny to slight caprice.\n\nAnd thus its jetted tragedy, its stele\nAnd shape and mournful making move to find\nWhat must unmake it and, at last, what can,\nSay, a flippant communication under the moon.\n\nVIII\nThere may be always a time of innocence.\n\nThere is never a place.\n\nOr if there is no time,\nIf it is not a thing of time, nor of place,\nExisting in the idea of it, alone,\nIn the sense against calamity, it is not\nLess real.\n\nFor the oldest and coldest philosopher,\nThere is or may be a time of innocence\nAs pure principle.\n\nIts nature is its end,\nThat it should be, and yet not be, a thing\nThat pinches the pity of the pitiful man,\nLike a book at evening beautiful but untrue,\nLike a book on rising beautiful and true.\n\nIt is like a thing of ether that exists\nAlmost as predicate.\n\nBut it exists,\nIt exists, it is visible, it is, it is.\n\nSo, then, these lights are not a spell of light,\nA saying out of a cloud, but innocence.\n\nAn innocence of the earth and no false sign\nOr symbol of malice.\n\nThat we partake thereof,\nLie down like children in this holiness,\nAs if, awake, we lay in the quiet of sleep,\nAs if the innocent mother sang in the dark\nOf the room and on an accordion, half-heard,\nCreated the time and place in which we breathed .\n\n\nIX\nAnd of each other thought\u2014in the idiom\nOf the work, in the idiom of an innocent earth,\nNot of the enigma of the guilty dream.\n\nWe were as Danes in Denmark all day long\nAnd knew each other well, hale-hearted landsmen,\nFor whom the outlandish was another day\nOf the week, queerer than Sunday.\n\nWe thought alike\nAnd that made brothers of us in a home\nIn which we fed on being brothers, fed\nAnd fattened as on a decorous honeycomb.\n\nThis drama that we live\u2014We lay sticky with sleep.\n\nThis sense of the activity of fate\u2014\nThe rendezvous, when she came alone,\nBy her coming became a freedom of the two,\nAn isolation which only the two could share.\n\nShall we be found hanging in the trees next spring?\n\nOf what disaster in this the imminence:\nBare limbs, bare trees and a wind as sharp as salt?\n\nThe stars are putting on their glittering belts.\n\nThey throw around their shoulders cloaks that flash\nLike a great shadow's last embellishment.\n\nIt may come tomorrow in the simplest word,\nAlmost as part of innocence, almost,\nAlmost as the tenderest and the truest part.\n\nX\nAn unhappy people in a happy world\u2014\nRead, rabbi, the phases of this difference.\n\nAn unhappy people in an unhappy world\u2014\nHere are too many mirrors for misery.\n\nA happy people in an unhappy world\u2014\nIt cannot be.\n\nThere's nothing there to roll\nOn the expressive tongue, the finding fang.\n\nA happy people in a happy world\u2014\nBuffo! A ball, an opera, a bar.\n\nTurn back to where we were when we began:\nAn unhappy people in a happy world.\n\nNow, solemnize the secretive syllables.\n\nRead to the congregation, for today\nAnd for tomorrow, this extremity,\nThis contrivance of the spectre of the spheres,\nContriving balance to contrive a whole,\nThe vital, the never-failing genius,\nFulfilling his meditations, great and small.\n\nIn these unhappy he meditates a whole,\nThe full of fortune and the full of fate,\nAs if he lived all lives, that he might know,\nIn hall harridan, not hushful paradise,\nTo a haggling of wind and weather, by these lights\nLike a blaze of summer straw, in winter's nick.\n", "period": "Modernist", "literary_movement": "Modernism", "register": "Meditative", "rhetorical_genre": "Epideictic", "discursive_structure": "Expository", "discourse_type": "Fictive", "narrative_level": "Extradiegetic", "diegetic_mimetic": NaN, "focalization": "Third person omniscient", "person": NaN, "deictic_orientation": NaN, "addressee_type": "Implied", "deictic_object": NaN, "temporal_orientation": "Present", "temporal_structure": "Static", "tradition": "Modernist Poetry", "mode": "Lyric", "genre": "Descriptive Poetry", "stanza_structure": "Quatrains", "meter": "Free verse", "rhyme": "A-B-A-B"}

gift\non a day nearly canceled by sunlight\nwhen the entire hill is approaching\nthe ideal of Virginia\nbrochured with goldenrod and loblolly\nand I think \"at least I have not woken up\nwith a bloody knife in my hand\"\nby then having absently wandered\none hundred yards from the house\nwhile still seated in this chair\nwith my eyes closed.\n\nIt is a certain hill\nthe one I imagine when I hear the word \"hill\"\nand if the apocalypse turns out\nto be a world-wide nervous breakdown\nif our five billion minds collapse at once\nwell I'd call that a surprise ending\nand this hill would still be beautiful\na place I wouldn't mind dying\nalone or with you.\n\nI am trying to get at something\nand I want to talk very plainly to you\nso that we are both comforted by the honesty.\n\nYou see there is a window by my desk\nI stare out when I am stuck\nthough the outdoors has rarely inspired me to write\nand I don't know why I keep staring at it.\n\nMy childhood hasn't made good material either\nmostly being a mulch of white minutes\nwith a few stand out moments,\npopping tar bubbles on the driveway in the summer\na certain amount of pride at school\neverytime they called it \"our sun\"\nand playing football when the only play\nwas \"go out long\" are what stand out now.\n\nIf squeezed for more information\nI can remember old clock radios\nwith flipping metal numbers\nand an entree called Surf and Turf.\n\nAs a way of getting in touch with my origins\nevery night I set the alarm clock\nfor the time I was born so that waking up\nbecomes a historical reenactment and the first thing I do\nis take a reading of the day and try to flow with it like\nwhen you're riding a mechanical bull and you strain to learn\nthe pattern quickly so you don't inadverantly resist it.\n\nII two\nI can't remember being born\nand no one else can remember it either\neven the doctor who I met years later\nat a cocktail party.\n\nIt's one of the little disappointments\nthat makes you think about getting away\ngoing to Holly Springs or Coral Gables\nand taking a room on the square\nwith a landlady whose hands are scored\nby disinfectant, telling the people you meet\nthat you are from Alaska, and listen\nto what they have to say about Alaska\nuntil you have learned much more about Alaska\nthan you ever will about Holly Springs or Coral Gables.\n\nSometimes I am buying a newspaper\nin a strange city and think\n\"I am about to learn what it's like to live here.\n\nOftentimes there is a news item\nabout the complaints of homeowners\nwho live beside the airport\nand I realize that I read an article\non this subject nearly once a year\nand always receive the same image.\n\nI am in bed late at night\nin my house near the airport\nlistening to the jets fly overhead\na strange wife sleeping beside me.\n\nIn my mind, the bedroom is an amalgamation\nof various cold medicine commercial sets\n(there is always a box of tissue on the nightstand).\n\nI know these recurring news articles are clues,\nflaws in the design though I haven't figured out\nhow to string them together yet,\nbut I've begun to notice that the same people\nare dying over and over again,\nfor instance Minnie Pearl\nwho died this year\nfor the fourth time in four years.\n\nIII three\nToday is the first day of Lent\nand once again I'm not really sure what it is.\n\nHow many more years will I let pass\nbefore I take the trouble to ask someone?\n\nIt reminds of this morning\nwhen you were getting ready for work.\n\nI was sitting by the space heater\nnumbly watching you dress\nand when you asked why I never wear a robe\nI had so many good reasons\nI didn't know where to begin.\n\nIf you were cool in high school\nyou didn't ask too many questions.\n\nYou could tell who'd been to last night's\nbig metal concert by the new t-shirts in the hallway.\n\nYou didn't have to ask\nand that's what cool was:\nthe ability to deduct\nto know without asking.\n\nAnd the pressure to simulate coolness\nmeans not asking when you don't know,\nwhich is why kids grow ever more stupid.\n\nA yearbook's endpages, filled with promises\nto stay in touch, stand as proof of the uselessness\nof a teenager's promise.\n\nNot like I'm dying\nfor a letter from the class stoner\nten years on but.\n\n\nDo you remember the way the girls\nwould call out \"love you!\"\nconveniently leaving out the \"I\"\nas if they didn't want to commit\nto their own declarations.\n\nI agree that the \"I\" is a pretty heavy concept\nand hope you won't get uncomfortable\nif I should go into some deeper stuff here.\n\nIV four\nThere are things I've given up on\nlike recording funny answering machine messages.\n\nIt's part of growing older\nand the human race as a group\nhas matured along the same lines.\n\nIt seems our comedy dates the quickest.\n\nIf you laugh out loud at Shakespeare's jokes\nI hope you won't be insulted\nif I say you're trying too hard.\n\nEven sketches from the original Saturday Night Live\nseem slow-witted and obvious now.\n\nIt's just that our advances are irrepressible.\n\nNowadays little kids can't even set up lemonade stands.\n\nIt makes people too self-conscious about the past,\nthough try explaining that to a kid.\n\nI'm not saying it should be this way.\n\nAll this new technology\nwill eventually give us new feelings\nthat will never completely displace the old ones\nleaving everyone feeling quite nervous\nand split in two.\n\nWe will travel to Mars\neven as folks on Earth\nare still ripping open potato chip\nbags with their teeth.\n\nWhy?\n\nI don't have the time or intelligence\nto make all the connections\nlike my friend Gordon\n(this is a true story)\nwho grew up in Braintree Massachusetts\nand had never pictured a brain snagged in a tree\nuntil I brought it up.\n\nHe'd never broken the name down to its parts.\n\nBy then it was too late.\n\nHe had moved to Coral Gables.\n\nV five\nThe hill out my window is still looking beautiful\nsuffused in a kind of gold national park light\nand it seems to say,\nI'm sorry the world could not possibly\nuse another poem about Orpheus\nbut I'm available if you're not working\non a self-portrait or anything.\n\nI'm watching my dog have nightmares,\ntwitching and whining on the office floor\nand I try to imagine what beast\nhas cornered him in the meadow\nwhere his dreams are set.\n\nI'm just letting the day be what it is:\na place for a large number of things\nto gather and interact --\nnot even a place but an occasion\na reality for real things.\n\nFriends warned me not to get too psychedelic\nor religious with this piece:\n\"They won't accept it if it's too psychedelic\nor religious,\" but these are valid topics\nand I'm the one with the dog twitching on the floor\npossibly dreaming of me\nthat part of me that would beat a dog\nfor no good reason\nno reason that a dog could see.\n\nI am trying to get at something so simple\nthat I have to talk plainly\nso the words don't disfigure it\nand if it turns out that what I say is untrue\nthen at least let it be harmless\nlike a leaky boat in the reeds\nthat is bothering no one.\n\nVI six\nI can't trust the accuracy of my own memories,\nmany of them having blended with sentimental\ntelephone and margarine commercials\nplainly ruined by Madison Avenue\nthough no one seems to call the advertising world\n\"Madison Avenue\" anymore.\n\nHave they moved?\n\nLet's get an update on this.\n\nBut first I have some business to take care of.\n\nI walked out to the hill behind our house\nwhich looks
