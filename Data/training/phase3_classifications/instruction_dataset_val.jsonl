from the windows!\nPier out from the main, let me catch myself with you, and stay\u2014I\nwill not chafe you,\nI feel ashamed to go naked about the world.\n\nI am curious to know where my feet stand\u2014and what this is flooding\nme, childhood or manhood\u2014and the hunger that crosses the\nbridge between.\n\nThe cloth laps a first sweet eating and drinking,\nLaps life-swelling yolks\u2014laps ear of rose-corn, milky and just\nripen'd;\nThe white teeth stay, and the boss-tooth advances in darkness,\nAnd liquor is spill'd on lips and bosoms by touching glasses, and the\nbest liquor afterward.\n\nI descend my western course, my sinews are flaccid,\nPerfume and youth course through me, and I am their wake.\n\nIt is my face yellow and wrinkled, instead of the old woman's,\nI sit low in a straw-bottom chair, and carefully darn my grandson's\nstockings.\n\nIt is I too, the sleepless widow, looking out on the winter midnight,\nI see the sparkles of starshine on the icy and pallid earth.\n\nA shroud I see, and I am the shroud\u2014I wrap a body, and lie in the\ncoffin,\nIt is dark here under ground\u2014it is not evil or pain here\u2014it is\nblank here, for reasons.\n\nIt seems to me that everything in the light and air ought to be\nhappy,\nWhoever is not in his coffin and the dark grave, let him know he has\nenough.\n\nI see a beautiful gigantic swimmer, swimming naked through the eddies\nof the sea,\nHis brown hair lies close and even to his head\u2014he strikes out with\ncourageous arms\u2014he urges himself with his legs,\nI see his white body\u2014I see his undaunted eyes,\nI hate the swift-running eddies that would dash him head-foremost on\nthe rocks.\n\nWhat are you doing, you ruffianly red-trickled waves?\n\nWill you kill the courageous giant?\n\nWill you kill him in the prime of\nhis middle age?\n\nSteady and long he struggles,\nHe is baffled, bang'd, bruis'd\u2014he holds out while his strength holds\nout,\nThe slapping

and out of sight is borne the brave corpse.\n\nI turn, but do not extricate myself,\nConfused, a past-reading, another, but with darkness yet.\n\nThe beach is cut by the razory ice-wind\u2014the wreck-guns sound,\nThe tempest lulls\u2014the moon comes floundering through the drifts.\n\nI look where the ship helplessly heads end on\u2014I hear the burst as\nshe strikes\u2014I hear the howls of dismay\u2014they grow fainter and\nfainter.\n\nI cannot aid with my wringing fingers,\nI can but rush to the surf, and let it drench me and freeze upon me.\n\nI search with the crowd\u2014not one of the company is wash'd to us\nalive;\nIn the morning I help pick up the dead and lay them in rows in a\nbarn.\n\nNow of the older war-days, the defeat at Brooklyn,\nWashington stands inside the lines\u2014he stands on the intrench'd\nhills, amid a crowd of officers,\nHis face is cold and damp\u2014he cannot repress the weeping drops,\nHe lifts the glass perpetually to his eyes\u2014the color is blanch'd\nfrom his cheeks,\nHe sees the slaughter of the southern braves confided to him by their\nparents.\n\nThe same, at last and at last, when peace is declared,\nHe stands in the room of the old tavern\u2014the well-belov'd soldiers\nall pass through,\nThe officers speechless and slow draw near in their turns,\nThe chief encircles their necks with his arm, and kisses them on the\ncheek,\nHe kisses lightly the wet cheeks one after another\u2014he shakes hands,\nand bids good-by to the army.\n\nNow I tell what my mother told me to-day as we sat at dinner\ntogether,\nOf when she was a nearly grown girl, living home with her parents on\nthe old homestead.\n\nA red squaw came one breakfast time to the old homestead,\nOn her back she carried a bundle of rushes for rush-bottoming chairs,\nHer hair, straight, shiny, coarse, black, profuse, half-envelop'd her\nface,\nHer step was free and elastic, and her voice sounded exquisitely as\nshe spoke.\n\nMy mother look'd in delight and amazement at the stranger,\nShe look'd at the freshness of her tall-borne face, and full and\npliant limbs,\nThe more she look'd upon her, she loved her,\nNever before had she seen such wonderful beauty and purity,\nShe made her sit on a bench by the jamb of the fireplace\u2014she cook'd\nfood for her,\nShe had no work to give her, but she gave her remembrance and\nfondness.\n\nThe red squaw staid all the forenoon, and toward the middle of the\nafternoon she went away,\nO my mother was loth to have her go away!\nAll the week she thought of her\u2014she watch'd for her many a month,\nShe remember'd her many a winter and many a summer,\nBut the red squaw never came, nor was heard of there again.\n\nNow Lucifer was not dead\u2014or if he was, I am his sorrowful terrible\nheir;\nI have been wrong'd\u2014I am oppress'd\u2014I hate him that oppresses me,\nI will either destroy him, or he shall release me.\n\nDamn him! how he does defile me!\nHow he informs against my brother and sister, and takes pay for their\nblood!\nHow he laughs when I look down the bend, after the steamboat that\ncarries away my woman!\nNow the vast dusk bulk that is the whale's bulk, it seems mine;\nWarily, sportsman! though I lie so sleepy and sluggish, the tap of my\nflukes is death.\n\nA show of the summer softness! a contact of something unseen! an\namour of the light and air!\nI am jealous, and overwhelm'd with friendliness,\nAnd will go gallivant with the light and air myself,\nAnd have an unseen something to be in contact with them also.\n\nO love and summer! you are in the dreams, and in me!\nAutumn and winter are in the dreams\u2014the farmer goes with his thrift,\nThe droves and crops increase, and the barns are well-fill'd.\n\nElements merge in the night\u2014ships make tacks in the dreams,\nThe sailor sails\u2014the exile returns home,\nThe fugitive returns unharm'd\u2014the immigrant is back beyond months\nand years,\nThe poor Irishman lives in the simple house of his childhood, with\nthe well-known neighbors and faces,\nThey warmly welcome him\u2014he is barefoot again, he forgets he is well\noff;\nThe Dutchman voyages home, and the Scotchman and Welshman voyage\nhome, and the native of the Mediterranean voyages home,\nTo every port of England, France, Spain, enter well-fill'd ships,\nThe Swiss foots it toward his hills\u2014the Prussian goes his way, the\nHungarian his way, and the Pole his way,\nThe Swede returns, and the Dane and Norwegian return.\n\nThe homeward bound, and the outward bound,\nThe beautiful lost swimmer, the ennuy\u00e9, the onanist, the\nfemale that loves unrequited, the money-maker,\nThe actor and actress, those through with their parts, and those\nwaiting to commence,\nThe affectionate boy, the husband and wife, the voter, the nominee\nthat is chosen, and the nominee that has fail'd,\nThe great already known, and the great any time after to-day,\nThe stammerer, the sick, the perfect-form'd, the homely,\nThe criminal that stood in the box, the judge that sat and sentenced\nhim, the fluent lawyers, the jury, the audience,\nThe laugher and weeper, the dancer, the midnight widow, the red\nsquaw,\nThe consumptive, the erysipelite, the idiot, he that is wrong'd,\nThe antipodes, and every one between this and them in the dark,\nI swear they are averaged now\u2014one is no better than the other,\nThe night and sleep have liken'd them and restored them.\n\nI swear they are all beautiful;\nEvery one that sleeps is beautiful\u2014everything in the dim light is\nbeautiful,\nThe wildest and bloodiest is over, and all is peace.\n\nPeace is always beautiful, The myth of heaven indicates peace and\nnight.\n\nThe myth of heaven indicates the Soul;\nThe Soul is always beautiful\u2014it appears more or it appears less\u2014it\ncomes, or it lags behind,\nIt comes from its embower'd garden, and looks pleasantly on itself,\nand encloses the world,\nPerfect and clean the genitals previously jetting, and perfect and\nclean the womb cohering,\nThe head well-grown, proportion'd and plumb, and the bowels and\njoints proportion'd and plumb.\n\nThe Soul is always beautiful,\nThe universe is duly in order, everything is in its place,\nWhat has arrived is in its place, and what waits is in its place;\nThe twisted skull waits, the watery or rotten blood waits,\nThe child of the glutton or venerealee waits long, and the child of\nthe drunkard waits long, and the drunkard himself waits long,\nThe sleepers that lived and died wait\u2014the far advanced are to go on\nin their turns, and the far behind are to come on in their\nturns,\nThe diverse shall be no less diverse, but they shall flow and unite\u2014\nthey unite now.\n\nThe sleepers are very beautiful as they lie unclothed,\nThey flow hand in hand over the whole earth, from east to west, as\nthey lie unclothed,\nThe Asiatic and African are hand in hand\u2014the European and American\nare hand in hand,\nLearn'd and unlearn'd are hand in hand, and male and female are hand\nin hand,\nThe bare arm of the girl crosses the bare breast of her lover\u2014they\npress close without lust\u2014his lips press her neck,\nThe father holds his grown or ungrown son in his arms with\nmeasureless love, and the son holds the father in his arms with\nmeasureless love,\nThe white hair of the mother shines on the white wrist of the\ndaughter,\nThe breath of the boy goes with the breath of the man, friend is\ninarm'd by friend,\nThe scholar kisses the teacher, and the teacher kisses the scholar\u2014\nthe wrong'd is made right,\nThe call of the slave is one with the master's call, and the master\nsalutes the slave,\nThe felon steps forth from the prison\u2014the insane becomes sane\u2014the\nsuffering of sick persons is reliev'd,\nThe sweatings and fevers stop\u2014the throat that was unsound is sound\u2014\nthe lungs of the consumptive are resumed\u2014the poor distress'd\nhead is free,\nThe joints of the rheumatic move as smoothly as ever, and smoother\nthan ever,\nStiflings and passages open\u2014the paralyzed become supple,\nThe swell'd and convuls'd and congested awake to themselves in\ncondition,\nThey pass the invigoration of the night, and the chemistry of the\nnight, and awake.\n\nI too pass from the night,\nI stay a while away, O night, but I return to you again, and love\nyou.\n\nWhy should I be afraid to trust myself to you?\n\nI am not afraid\u2014I have been well brought forward by you;\nI love the rich running day, but I do not desert her in whom I lay so\nlong,\nI know not how I came of you, and I know not where I go with you\u2014but\nI know I came well, and shall go well.\n\nI will stop only a time with the night, and rise betimes;\nI will duly pass the day, O my mother, and duly return to you.\n\nProvide classifications for the following 28 fields:\n\nHISTORICAL:\n- period\n-

Tu\u2014whoo!\nAnd hark, again! the crowing cock,\nHow drowsily it crew.\n\nSir Leoline, the Baron rich,\nHath a toothless mastiff bitch;\nFrom her kennel beneath the rock\nShe maketh answer to the clock,\nFour for the quarters, and twelve for the hour;\nEver and aye, by shine and shower,\nSixteen short howls, not over loud;\nSome say, she sees my lady's shroud.\n\nIs the night chilly and dark?\n\nThe night is chilly, but not dark.\n\nThe thin gray cloud is spread on high,\nIt covers but not hides the sky.\n\nThe moon is behind, and at the full;\nAnd yet she looks both small and dull.\n\nThe night is chill, the cloud is gray:\n'Tis a month before the month of May,\nAnd the Spring comes slowly up this way.\n\nThe lovely lady, Christabel,\nWhom her father loves so well,\nWhat makes her in the wood so late,\nA furlong from the castle gate?\n\nShe had dreams all yesternight\nOf her own betroth\u00e8d knight;\nAnd she in the midnight wood will pray\nFor the weal of her lover that's far away.\n\nShe stole along, she nothing spoke,\nThe sighs she heaved were soft and low,\nAnd naught was green upon the oak\nBut moss and rarest misletoe:\nShe kneels beneath the huge oak tree,\nAnd in silence prayeth she.\n\nThe lady sprang up suddenly,\nThe lovely lady Christabel!\nIt moaned as near, as near can be,\nBut what it is she cannot tell.\n\nOn the other side it seems to be,\nOf the huge, broad-breasted, old oak tree.\n\nThe night is chill; the forest bare;\nIs it the wind that moaneth bleak?\n\nThere is not wind enough in the air\nTo move away the ringlet curl\nFrom the lovely lady's cheek\u2014\nThere is not wind enough to twirl\nThe one red leaf, the last of its clan,\nThat dances as often as dance it can,\nHanging so light, and hanging so high,\nOn the topmost twig that looks up at the sky.\n\nHush, beating heart of Christabel!\nJesu, Maria, shield her well!\nShe folded her arms beneath her cloak,\nAnd stole to the other side of the oak.\n\nWhat sees she there?\n\nThere she sees a damsel bright,\nDrest in a silken robe of white,\nThat shadowy in the moonlight shone:\nThe neck that made that white robe wan,\nHer stately neck, and arms were bare;\nHer blue-veined feet unsandl'd were,\nAnd wildly glittered here and there\nThe gems entangled in her hair.\n\nI guess, 'twas frightful there to see\nA lady so richly clad as she\u2014\nBeautiful exceedingly!\n\nMary mother, save me now!\n(Said Christabel) And who art thou?\n\nThe lady strange made answer meet,\nAnd her voice was faint and sweet:\u2014\nHave pity on my sore distress,\nI scarce can speak for weariness:\nStretch forth thy hand, and have no fear!\nSaid Christabel, How camest thou here?\n\nAnd the lady, whose voice was faint and sweet,\nDid thus pursue her answer meet:\u2014\n\nMy sire is of a noble line,\nAnd my name is Geraldine:\nFive warriors seized me yestermorn,\nMe, even me, a maid forlorn:\nThey choked my cries with force and fright,\nAnd tied me on a palfrey white.\n\nThe palfrey was as fleet as wind,\nAnd they rode furiously behind.\n\nThey spurred amain, their steeds were white:\nAnd once we crossed the shade of night.\n\nAs sure as Heaven shall rescue me,\nI have no thought what men they be;\nNor do I know how long it is\n(For I have lain entranced I wis)\nSince one, the tallest of the five,\nTook me from the palfrey's back,\nA weary woman, scarce alive.\n\nSome muttered words his comrades spoke:\nHe placed me underneath this oak;\nHe swore they would return with haste;\nWhither they went I cannot tell\u2014\nI thought I heard, some minutes past,\nSounds as of a castle bell.\n\nStretch forth thy hand (thus ended she).\n\nAnd help a wretched maid to flee.\n\nThen Christabel stretched forth her hand,\nAnd comforted fair Geraldine:\nO well, bright dame! may you command\nThe service of Sir Leoline;\nAnd gladly our stout chivalry\nWill he send forth and friends withal\nTo guide and guard you safe and free\nHome to your noble father's hall.\n\nShe rose: and forth with steps they passed\nThat strove to be, and were not, fast.\n\nHer gracious stars the lady blest,\nAnd thus spake on sweet Christabel:\nAll our household are at rest,\nThe hall as silent as the cell;\nSir Leoline is weak in health,\nAnd may not well awakened be,\nBut we will move as if in stealth,\nAnd I beseech your courtesy,\nThis night, to share your couch with me.\n\nThey crossed the moat, and Christabel\nTook the key that fitted well;\nA little door she opened straight,\nAll in the middle of the gate;\nThe gate that was ironed within and without,\nWhere an army in battle array had marched out.\n\nThe lady sank, belike through pain,\nAnd Christabel with might and main\nLifted her up, a weary weight,\nOver the threshold of the gate:\nThen the lady rose again,\nAnd moved, as she were not in pain.\n\nSo free from danger, free from fear,\nThey crossed the court: right glad they were.\n\nAnd Christabel devoutly cried\nTo the lady by her side,\nPraise we the Virgin all divine\nWho hath rescued thee from thy distress!\nAlas, alas! said Geraldine,\nI cannot speak for weariness.\n\nSo free from danger, free from fear,\nThey crossed the court: right glad they were.\n\nOutside her kennel, the mastiff old\nLay fast asleep, in moonshine cold.\n\nThe mastiff old did not awake,\nYet she an angry moan did make!\nAnd what can ail the mastiff bitch?\n\nNever till now she uttered yell\nBeneath the eye of Christabel.\n\nPerhaps it is the owlet's scritch:\nFor what can ail the mastiff bitch?\n\nThey passed the hall, that echoes still,\nPass as lightly as you will!\nThe brands were flat, the brands were dying,\nAmid their own white ashes lying;\nBut when the lady passed, there came\nA tongue of light, a fit of flame;\nAnd Christabel saw the lady's eye,\nAnd nothing else saw she thereby,\nSave the boss of the shield of Sir Leoline tall,\nWhich hung in a murky old niche in the wall.\n\nO softly tread, said Christabel,\nMy father seldom sleepeth well.\n\nSweet Christabel her feet doth bare,\nAnd jealous of the listening air\nThey steal their way from stair to stair,\nNow in glimmer, and now in gloom,\nAnd now they pass the Baron's room,\nAs still as death, with stifled breath!\nAnd now have reached her chamber door;\nAnd now doth Geraldine press down\nThe rushes of the chamber floor.\n\nThe moon shines dim in the open air,\nAnd not a moonbeam enters here.\n\nBut they without its light can see\nThe chamber carved so curiously,\nCarved with figures strange and sweet,\nAll made out of the carver's brain,\nFor a lady's chamber meet:\nThe lamp with twofold silver chain\nIs fastened to an angel's feet.\n\nThe silver lamp burns dead and dim;\nBut Christabel the lamp will trim.\n\nShe trimmed the lamp, and made it bright,\nAnd left it swinging to and fro,\nWhile Geraldine, in wretched plight,\nSank down upon the floor below.\n\nO weary lady, Geraldine,\nI pray you, drink this cordial wine!\nIt is a wine of virtuous powers;\nMy mother made it of wild flowers.\n\nAnd will your mother pity me,\nWho am a maiden most forlorn?\n\nChristabel answered\u2014Woe is me!\nShe died the hour that I was born.\n\nI have heard the grey-haired friar tell\nHow on her death-bed she did say,\nThat she should hear the castle-bell\nStrike twelve upon my wedding-day.\n\nO mother dear! that thou wert here!\nI would, said Geraldine, she were!\n\nBut soon with altered voice, said she\u2014\n'Off, wandering mother! Peak and pine!\nI have power to bid thee flee.\n\nAlas! what ails poor Geraldine?\n\nWhy stares she with unsettled eye?\n\nCan she the bodiless dead espy?\n\nAnd why with hollow voice cries she,\n'Off, woman, off! this hour is mine\u2014\nThough thou her guardian spirit be,\nOff, woman, off! 'tis given to me.\n\n\nThen Christabel knelt by the lady's side,\nAnd raised to heaven her eyes so blue\u2014\nAlas! said she, this ghastly ride\u2014\nDear lady! it hath wildered you!\nThe lady wiped her moist cold brow,\nAnd faintly said, ' 'tis over now!'\n\nAgain the wild-flower wine she drank:\nHer fair large eyes 'gan glitter bright,\nAnd from the floor whereon she sank,\nThe lofty lady stood upright:\nShe was most beautiful to see,\nLike a lady of a far countr\u00e8e.\n\nAnd thus the lofty lady spake\u2014\n'All they who live in the upper sky,\nDo love you, holy Christabel!\nAnd you love them, and for their sake\nAnd for the good which me befel,\nEven I in my degree will try,\nFair maiden, to requite you well.\n\nBut now unrobe yourself; for I\nMust pray, ere yet in bed I lie.\n\n\nQuoth Christabel, So let it be!\nAnd as the lady bade, did she.\n\nHer gentle limbs did she undress,\nAnd lay down in her loveliness.\n\nBut through her brain of weal and woe\nSo many thoughts moved to and fro,\nThat vain it were her lids to close;\nSo half-way from the bed she rose,\nAnd on her elbow did recline\nTo look at the lady Geraldine.\n\nBeneath the lamp the lady bowed,\nAnd slowly rolled her eyes around;\nThen drawing in her breath aloud,\nLike one that shuddered, she unbound\nThe cincture from beneath her breast:\nHer silken robe, and inner vest,\nDropt to her feet, and full in view,\nBehold! her bosom and half her side\u2014\nA sight to dream of, not to tell!\nO shield her! shield sweet Christabel!\n\nYet Geraldine nor speaks nor stirs;\nAh! what a stricken look was hers!\nDeep from within she seems half-way\nTo lift some weight with sick assay,\nAnd eyes the maid and seeks delay;\nThen suddenly, as one defied,\nCollects herself in scorn and pride,\nAnd lay down by the Maiden's side!\u2014\nAnd in her arms the maid she took,\nAh wel-a-day!\nAnd with low voice and doleful look\nThese words did say:\n'In the touch of this bosom there worketh a spell,\nWhich is lord of thy utterance, Christabel!\nThou knowest to-night, and wilt know to-morrow,\nThis mark of my shame, this seal of my sorrow;\nBut vainly thou warrest,\nFor this is alone in\nThy power to declare,\nThat in the dim forest\nThou heard'st a low moaning,\nAnd found'st a bright lady, surpassingly fair;\nAnd didst bring her home with thee in love and in charity,\nTo shield her and shelter her from the damp air.\n\n\nTHE CONCLUSION TO PART I\nIt was a lovely sight to see\nThe lady Christabel, when she\nWas praying at the old oak tree.\n\nAmid the jagg\u00e8d shadows\nOf mossy leafless boughs,\nKneeling in the moonlight,\nTo make her gentle vows;\nHer slender palms together prest,\nHeaving sometimes on her breast;\nHer face resigned to bliss or bale\u2014\nHer face, oh call it fair not pale,\nAnd both blue eyes more bright than clear,\nEach about to have a tear.\n\nWith open eyes (ah woe is me!)\nAsleep, and dreaming fearfully,\nFearfully dreaming, yet, I wis,\nDreaming that alone, which is\u2014\nO sorrow and shame! Can this be she,\nThe lady, who knelt at the old oak tree?\n\nAnd lo! the worker of these harms,\nThat holds the maiden in her arms,\nSeems to slumber still and mild,\nAs a mother with her child.\n\nA star hath set, a star hath risen,\nO Geraldine! since arms of thine\nHave been the lovely lady's prison.\n\nO Geraldine! one hour was thine\u2014\nThou'st had thy will! By tairn and rill,\nThe night-birds all that hour were still.\n\nBut now they are jubilant anew,\nFrom cliffand tower, tu\u2014whoo! tu\u2014whoo!\nTu\u2014whoo! tu\u2014whoo! from wood and fell!\n\nAnd see! the lady Christabel\nGathers herself from out her trance;\nHer limbs relax, her countenance\nGrows sad and soft; the smooth thin lids\nClose o'er her eyes; and tears she sheds\u2014\nLarge tears that leave the lashes bright!\nAnd oft the while she seems to smile\nAs infants at a sudden light!\n\nYea, she doth smile, and she doth weep,\nLike a youthful hermitess,\nBeauteous in a wilderness,\nWho, praying always, prays in sleep.\n\nAnd, if she move unquietly,\nPerchance, 'tis but the blood so free\nComes back and tingles in her feet.\n\nNo doubt, she hath a vision sweet.\n\nWhat if her guardian spirit 'twere,\nWhat if she knew her mother near?\n\nBut this she knows, in joys and woes,\nThat saints will aid if men will call:\nFor the blue sky bends over all!\n\nPART II\nEach matin bell, the Baron saith,\nKnells us back to a world of death.\n\nThese words Sir Leoline first said,\nWhen he rose and found his lady dead:\nThese words Sir Leoline will say\nMany a morn to his dying day!\n\nAnd hence the custom and law began\nThat still at dawn the sacristan,\nWho duly pulls the heavy bell,\nFive and forty beads must tell\nBetween each stroke\u2014a warning knell,\nWhich not a soul can choose but hear\nFrom Bratha Head to Wyndermere.\n\nSaith Bracy the bard, So let it knell!\nAnd let the drowsy sacristan\nStill count as slowly as he can!\nThere is no lack of such, I ween,\nAs well fill up the space between.\n\nIn Langdale Pike and Witch's Lair,\nAnd Dungeon-ghyll so foully rent,\nWith ropes of rock and bells of air\nThree sinful sextons' ghosts are pent,\nWho all give back, one after t'other,\nThe death-note to their living brother;\nAnd oft too, by the knell offended,\nJust as their one! two! three! is ended,\nThe devil mocks the doleful tale\nWith a merry peal from Borodale.\n\nThe air is still! through mist and cloud\nThat merry peal comes ringing loud;\nAnd Geraldine shakes off her dread,\nAnd rises lightly from the bed;\nPuts on her silken vestments white,\nAnd tricks her hair in lovely plight,\nAnd nothing doubting of her spell\nAwakens the lady Christabel.\n\n'Sleep you, sweet lady Christabel?\n\nI trust that you have rested well.\n\n\nAnd Christabel awoke and spied\nThe same who lay down by her side\u2014\nO rather say, the same whom she\nRaised up beneath the old oak tree!\nNay, fairer yet! and yet more fair!\nFor she belike hath drunken deep\nOf all the blessedness of sleep!\nAnd while she spake, her looks, her air\nSuch gentle thankfulness declare,\nThat (so it seemed) her girded vests\nGrew tight beneath her heaving breasts.\n\n'Sure I have sinn'd!' said Christabel,\n'Now heaven be praised if all be well!'\n\nAnd in low faltering tones, yet sweet,\nDid she the lofty lady greet\nWith such perplexity of mind\nAs dreams too lively leave behind.\n\nSo quickly she rose, and quickly arrayed\nHer maiden limbs, and having prayed\nThat He, who on the cross did groan,\nMight wash away her sins unknown,\nShe forthwith led fair Geraldine\nTo meet her sire, Sir Leoline.\n\nThe lovely maid and the lady tall\nAre pacing both into the hall,\nAnd pacing on through page and groom,\n\nThe Baron rose, and while he prest\nHis gentle daughter to his breast,\nWith cheerful wonder in his eyes\nThe lady Geraldine espies,\nAnd gave such welcome to the same,\nAs might beseem so bright a dame!\n\nBut when he heard the lady's tale,\nAnd when she told her father's name,\nWhy waxed Sir Leoline so pale,\nMurmuring o'er the name again,\nLord Roland de Vaux of Tryermaine?\n\nAlas! they had been friends in youth;\nBut whispering tongues can poison truth;\nAnd constancy lives in realms above;\nAnd life is thorny; and youth is vain;\nAnd to be wroth with one we love\nDoth work like madness in the brain.\n\nAnd thus it chanced, as I divine,\nWith Roland and Sir Leoline.\n\nEach spake words of high disdain\nAnd insult to his heart's best brother:\nThey parted\u2014ne'er to meet again!\nBut never either found another\nTo free the hollow heart from paining\u2014\nThey stood aloof, the scars remaining,\nLike cliffs which had been rent asunder;\nA dreary sea now flows between;\u2014\nBut neither heat, nor frost, nor thunder,\nShall wholly do away, I ween,\nThe marks of that which once hath been.\n\nSir Leoline, a moment's space,\nStood gazing on the damsel's face:\nAnd the youthful Lord of Tryermaine\nCame back upon his heart again.\n\nO then the Baron forgot his age,\nHis noble heart swelled high with rage;\nHe swore by the wounds in Jesu's side\nHe would proclaim it far and wide,\nWith trump and solemn heraldry,\nThat they, who thus had wronged the dame,\nWere base as spotted infamy!\n'And if they dare deny the same,\nMy herald shall appoint a week,\nAnd let the recreant traitors seek\nMy tourney court\u2014that there and then\nI may dislodge their reptile souls\nFrom the bodies and forms of men!'\nHe spake: his eye in lightning rolls!\nFor the lady was ruthlessly seized; and he kenned\nIn the beautiful lady the child of his friend!\n\nAnd now the tears were on his face,\nAnd fondly in his arms he took\nFair Geraldine, who met the embrace,\nProlonging it with joyous look.\n\nWhich when she viewed, a vision fell\nUpon the soul of Christabel,\nThe vision of fear, the touch and pain!\nShe shrunk and shuddered, and saw again\u2014\n(Ah, woe is me! Was it for thee,\nThou gentle maid! such sights to see?\n\n\nAgain she saw that bosom old,\nAgain she felt that bosom cold,\nAnd drew in her breath with a hissing sound:\nWhereat the Knight turned wildly round,\nAnd nothing saw, but his own sweet maid\nWith eyes upraised, as one that prayed.\n\nThe touch, the sight, had passed away,\nAnd in its stead that vision blest,\nWhich comforted her after-rest\nWhile in the lady's arms she lay,\nHad put a rapture in her breast,\nAnd on her lips and o'er her eyes\nSpread smiles like light!\nWith new surprise,\n'What ails then my belov\u00e8d child?\n\nThe Baron said\u2014His daughter mild\nMade answer, 'All will yet be well!'\nI ween, she had no power to tell\nAught else: so mighty was the spell.\n\nYet he, who saw this Geraldine,\nHad deemed her sure a thing divine:\nSuch sorrow with such grace she blended,\nAs if she feared she had offended\nSweet Christabel, that gentle maid!\nAnd with such lowly tones she prayed\nShe might be sent without delay\nHome to her father's mansion.\n\n'Nay!\nNay, by my soul!' said Leoline.\n\n'Ho! Bracy the bard, the charge be thine!\nGo thou, with sweet music and loud,\nAnd take two steeds with trappings proud,\nAnd take the youth whom thou lov'st best\nTo bear thy harp, and learn thy song,\nAnd clothe you both in solemn vest,\nAnd over the mountains haste along,\nLest wandering folk, that are abroad,\nDetain you on the valley road.\n\n'And when he has crossed the Irthing flood,\nMy merry bard! he hastes, he hastes\nUp Knorren Moor, through Halegarth Wood,\nAnd reaches soon that castle good\nWhich stands and threatens Scotland's wastes.\n\n'Bard Bracy! bard Bracy! your horses are fleet,\nYe must ride up the hall, your music so sweet,\nMore loud than your horses' echoing feet!\nAnd loud and loud to Lord Roland call,\nThy daughter is safe in Langdale hall!\nThy beautiful daughter is safe and free\u2014\nSir Leoline greets thee thus through me!\nHe bids thee come without delay\nWith all thy numerous array\nAnd take thy lovely daughter home:\nAnd he will meet thee on the way\nWith all his numerous array\nWhite with their panting palfreys' foam:\nAnd, by mine honour! I will say,\nThat I repent me of the day\nWhen I spake words of fierce disdain\nTo Roland de Vaux of Tryermaine!\u2014\n\u2014For since that evil hour hath flown,\nMany a summer's sun hath shone;\nYet ne'er found I a friend again\nLike Roland de Vaux of Tryermaine.\n\nThe lady fell, and clasped his knees,\nHer face upraised, her eyes o'erflowing;\nAnd Bracy replied, with faltering voice,\nHis gracious Hail on all bestowing!\u2014\n'Thy words, thou sire of Christabel,\nAre sweeter than my harp can tell;\nYet might I gain a boon of thee,\nThis day my journey should not be,\nSo strange a dream hath come to me,\nThat I had vowed with music loud\nTo clear yon wood from thing unblest.\n\nWarned by a vision in my rest!\nFor in my sleep I saw that dove,\nThat gentle bird, whom thou dost love,\nAnd call'st by thy own daughter's name\u2014\nSir Leoline! I saw the same\nFluttering, and uttering fearful moan,\nAmong the green herbs in the forest alone.\n\nWhich when I saw and when I heard,\nI wonder'd what might ail the bird;\nFor nothing near it could I see\nSave the grass and green herbs underneath the old tree.\n\n'And in my dream methought I went\nTo search out what might there be found;\nAnd what the sweet bird's trouble meant,\nThat thus lay fluttering on the ground.\n\nI went and peered, and could descry\nNo cause for her distressful cry;\nBut yet for her dear lady's sake\nI stooped, methought, the dove to take,\nWhen lo! I saw a bright green snake\nCoiled around its wings and neck.\n\nGreen as the herbs on which it couched,\nClose by the dove's its head it crouched;\nAnd with the dove it heaves and stirs,\nSwelling its neck as she swelled hers!\nI woke; it was the midnight hour,\nThe clock was echoing in the tower;\nBut though my slumber was gone by,\nThis dream it would not pass away\u2014\nIt seems to live upon my eye!\n\nAnd thence I vowed this self-same day\nWith music strong and saintly song\nTo wander through the forest bare,\nLest aught unholy loiter there.\n\n\nThus Bracy said: the Baron, the while,\nHalf-listening heard him with a smile;\nThen turned to Lady Geraldine,\nHis eyes made up of wonder and love;\nAnd said in courtly accents fine,\n'Sweet maid, Lord Roland's beauteous dove,\nWith arms more strong than harp or song,\nThy sire and I will crush the snake!'\nHe kissed her forehead as he spake,\nAnd Geraldine in maiden wise\nCasting down her large bright eyes,\nWith blushing cheek and courtesy fine\nShe turned her from Sir Leoline;\nSoftly gathering up her train,\nThat o'er her right arm fell again;\nAnd folded her arms across her chest,\nAnd couched her head upon her breast,\nAnd looked askance at Christabel\nJesu, Maria, shield her well!\n\nA snake's small eye blinks dull and shy;\nAnd the lady's eyes they shrunk in her head,\nEach shrunk up to a serpent's eye\nAnd with somewhat of malice, and more of dread,\nAt Christabel she looked askance!\u2014\nOne moment\u2014and the sight was fled!\nBut Christabel in dizzy trance\nStumbling on the unsteady ground\nShuddered aloud, with a hissing sound;\nAnd Geraldine again turned round,\nAnd like a thing, that sought relief,\nFull of wonder and full of grief,\nShe rolled her large bright eyes divine\nWildly on Sir Leoline.\n\nThe maid, alas! her thoughts are gone,\nShe nothing sees\u2014no sight but one!\nThe maid, devoid of guile and sin,\nI know not how, in fearful wise,\nSo deeply she had drunken in\nThat look, those shrunken serpent eyes,\nThat all her features were resigned\nTo this sole image in her mind:\nAnd passively did imitate\nThat look of dull and treacherous hate!\nAnd thus she stood, in dizzy trance;\nStill picturing that look askance\nWith forced unconscious sympathy\nFull before her father's view\u2014\nAs far as such a look could be\nIn eyes so innocent and blue!\n\nAnd when the trance was o'er, the maid\nPaused awhile, and inly prayed:\nThen falling at the Baron's feet,\n'By my mother's soul do I entreat\nThat thou this woman send away!'\nShe said: and more she could not say:\nFor what she knew she could not tell,\nO'er-mastered by the mighty spell.\n\nWhy is thy cheek so wan and wild,\nSir Leoline?\n\nThy only child\nLies at thy feet, thy joy, thy pride,\nSo fair, so innocent, so mild;\nThe same, for whom thy lady died!\nO by the pangs of her dear mother\nThink thou no evil of thy child!\nFor her, and thee, and for no other,\nShe prayed the moment ere she died:\nPrayed that the babe for whom she died,\nMight prove her dear lord's joy and pride!\nThat prayer her deadly pangs beguiled,\nSir Leoline!\nAnd wouldst thou wrong thy only child,\nHer child and thine?\n\nWithin the Baron's heart and brain\nIf thoughts, like these, had any share,\nThey only swelled his rage and pain,\nAnd did but work confusion there.\n\nHis heart was cleft with pain and rage,\nHis cheeks they quivered, his eyes were wild,\nDishonoured thus in his old age;\nDishonoured by his only child,\nAnd all his hospitality\nTo the wronged daughter of his friend\nBy more than woman's jealousy\nBrought thus to a disgraceful end\u2014\nHe rolled his eye with stern regard\nUpon the gentle minstrel bard,\nAnd said in tones abrupt, austere\u2014\n'Why, Bracy! dost thou loiter here?\n\nI bade thee hence!'

strength beyond hope and despair\nClimbing the third stair.\n\nLord, I am not worthy\nLord, I am not worthy\nbut speak the word only.\n\nIV\nWho walked between the violet and the violet\nWho walked between\nThe various ranks of varied green\nGoing in white and blue, in Mary's colour,\nTalking of trivial things\nIn ignorance and knowledge of eternal dolour\nWho moved among the others as they walked,\nWho then made strong the fountains and made fresh the springs\nMade cool the dry rock and made firm the sand\nIn blue of larkspur, blue of Mary's colour,\nSovegna vos\nHere are the years that walk between, bearing\nAway the fiddles and the flutes, restoring\nOne who moves in the time between sleep and waking, wearing\nWhite light folded, sheathing about her, folded.\n\nThe new years walk, restoring\nThrough a bright cloud of tears, the years, restoring\nWith a new verse the ancient rhyme.\n\nRedeem\nThe time.\n\nRedeem\nThe unread vision in the higher dream\nWhile jewelled unicorns draw by the gilded hearse.\n\nThe silent sister veiled in white and blue\nBetween the yews, behind the garden god,\nWhose flute is breathless, bent her head and signed but spoke no word\nBut the fountain sprang up and the bird sang down\nRedeem the time, redeem the dream\nThe token of the word unheard, unspoken\nTill the wind shake a thousand whispers from the yew\nAnd after this our exile\nV\nIf the lost word is lost, if the spent word is spent\nIf the unheard, unspoken\nWord is unspoken, unheard;\nStill is the unspoken word, the Word unheard,\nThe Word without a word, the Word within\nThe world and for the world;\nAnd the light shone in darkness and\nAgainst the Word the unstilled world still whirled\nAbout the centre of the silent Word.\n\nO my people, what have I done unto thee.\n\nWhere shall the word be found, where will the word\nResound?\n\nNot here, there is not enough silence\nNot on the sea or on the islands, not\nOn the mainland, in the desert or the rain land,\nFor those who walk in darkness\nBoth in the day time and in the night time\nThe right time and the right place are not here\nNo place of grace for those who avoid the face\nNo time to rejoice for those who walk among noise and deny the voice\nWill the veiled sister pray for\nThose who walk in darkness, who chose thee and oppose thee,\nThose who are torn on the horn between season and season, time and time, between\nHour and hour, word and word, power and power, those who wait\nIn darkness?\n\nWill the veiled sister pray\nFor children at the gate\nWho will not go away and cannot pray:\nPray for those who chose and oppose\nO my people, what have I done unto thee.\n\nWill the veiled sister between the slender\nYew trees pray for those who offend her\nAnd are terrified and cannot surrender\nAnd affirm before the world and deny between the rocks\nIn the last desert before the last blue rocks\nThe desert in the garden the garden in the desert\nOf drouth, spitting from the mouth the withered apple-seed.\n\nO my people.\n\nVI\nAlthough I do not hope to turn again\nAlthough I do not hope\nAlthough I do not hope to turn\nWavering between the profit and the loss\nIn this brief transit where the dreams cross\nThe dreamcrossed twilight between birth and dying\n(Bless me father) though I do not wish to wish these things\nFrom the wide window towards the granite shore\nThe white sails still fly seaward, seaward flying\nUnbroken wings\nAnd the lost heart stiffens and rejoices\nIn the lost lilac and the lost sea voices\nAnd the weak spirit quickens to rebel\nFor the bent golden-rod and the lost sea smell\nQuickens to recover\nThe cry of quail and the whirling plover\nAnd the blind eye creates\nThe empty forms between the ivory gates\nAnd smell renews the salt savour of the sandy earth\nThis is the time of tension between dying and birth\nThe place of solitude where three dreams cross\nBetween blue rocks\nBut when the voices shaken from the yew-tree drift away\nLet the other yew be shaken and reply.\n\nBless\u00e8d sister, holy mother, spirit of the fountain, spirit of the garden,\nSuffer us not to mock ourselves with falsehood\nTeach us to care and not to care\nTeach us to sit still\nEven among these rocks,\nOur peace in His will\nAnd even among these rocks\nSister, mother\nAnd spirit of the river, spirit of the sea,\nSuffer me not to be separated\nAnd let my cry come unto Thee.\n\n\nProvide classifications for the following 28 fields:\n\nHISTORICAL:\n- period\n- literary_movement\n\nRHETORICAL:\n- register\n- rhetorical_genre\n- discursive_structure\n- discourse_type\n- narrative_level\n- diegetic_mimetic\n- focalization\n- person\n- deictic_orientation\n- addressee_type\n- deictic_object\n- temporal_orientation\n- temporal_structure\n- tradition\n\nFORMAL:\n- mode\n- genre\n- stanza_structure\n- meter\n- rhyme\n\nFormat your response as:\nperiod: [value]\nliterary_movement: [value]\n...

{"prompt": "Classify the following poem across 28 metadata dimensions:\n\nTitle: The Palace of Art\nAuthor: Alfred Tennyson\nYear: 1832\n\nPoem:\nI built my soul a lordly pleasure-house,\nWherein at ease for aye to dwell.\n\nI said, \"O Soul, make merry and carouse,\nDear soul, for all is well.\n\nA huge crag-platform, smooth as burnish'd brass\nI chose.\n\nThe ranged ramparts bright\nFrom level meadow-bases of deep grass\nSuddenly scaled the light.\n\nThereon I built it firm.\n\nOf ledge or shelf\nThe rock rose clear, or winding stair.\n\nMy soul would live alone unto herself\nIn her high palace there.\n\nAnd \"while the world runs round and round,\" I said,\n\"Reign thou apart, a quiet king,\nStill as, while Saturn whirls, his steadfast shade\nSleeps on his luminous ring.\n\nTo which my soul made answer readily:\n\"Trust me, in bliss I shall abide\nIn this great mansion, that is built for me,\nSo royal-rich and wide.\n\nFour courts I made, East, West and South and North,\nIn each a squared lawn, wherefrom\nThe golden gorge of dragons spouted forth\nA flood of fountain-foam.\n\nAnd round the cool green courts there ran a row\nOf cloisters, branch'd like mighty woods,\nEchoing all night to that sonorous flow\nOf spouted fountain-floods.\n\nAnd round the roofs a gilded gallery\nThat lent broad verge to distant lands,\nFar as the wild swan wings, to where the sky\nDipt down to sea and sands.\n\nFrom those four jets four currents in one swell\nAcross the mountain stream'd below\nIn misty folds, that floating as they fell\nLit up a torrent-bow.\n\nAnd high on every peak a statue seem'd\nTo hang on tiptoe, tossing up\nA cloud of incense of all odour steam'd\nFrom out a golden cup.\n\nSo that she thought, \"And who shall gaze upon\nMy palace with unblinded eyes,\nWhile this great bow will waver in the sun,\nAnd that sweet incense rise?\n\nFor that sweet incense rose and never fail'd,\nAnd, while day sank or mounted higher,\nThe light a\u00ebrial gallery, golden-rail'd,\nBurnt like a fringe of fire.\n\nLikewise the deep-set windows, stain'd and traced,\nWould seem slow-flaming crimson fires\nFrom shadow'd grots of arches interlaced,\nAnd tipt with frost-like spires.\n\nFull of long-sounding corridors it was,\nThat over-vaulted grateful gloom,\nThro' which the livelong day my soul did pass,\nWell-pleased, from room to room.\n\nFull of great rooms and small the palace stood,\nAll various, each a perfect whole\nFrom living Nature, fit for every mood\nAnd change of my still soul.\n\nFor some were hung with arras green and blue,\nShowing a gaudy summer-morn,\nWhere with puff'd cheek the belted hunter blew\nHis wreathed bugle-horn.\n\nOne seem'd all dark and red\u2014a tract of sand,\nAnd some one pacing there alone,\nWho paced for ever in a glimmering land,\nLit with a low large moon.\n\nOne show'd an iron coast and angry waves.\n\nYou seem'd to hear them climb and fall\nAnd roar rock-thwarted under bellowing caves,\nBeneath the windy wall.\n\nAnd one, a full-fed river winding slow\nBy herds upon an endless plain,\nThe ragged rims of thunder brooding low,\nWith shadow-streaks of rain.\n\nAnd one, the reapers at their sultry toil.\n\nIn front they bound the sheaves.\n\nBehind\nWere realms of upland, prodigal in oil,\nAnd hoary to the wind.\n\nAnd one a foreground black with stones and slags,\nBeyond, a line of heights, and higher\nAll barr'd with long white cloud the scornful crags,\nAnd highest, snow and fire.\n\nAnd one, an English home\u2014gray twilight pour'd\nOn dewy pastures, dewy trees,\nSofter than sleep\u2014all things in order stored,\nA haunt of ancient Peace.\n\nNor these alone, but every landscape fair,\nAs fit for every mood of mind,\nOr gay, or grave, or sweet, or stern, was there,\nNot less than truth design'd.\n\nOr the maid-mother by a crucifix,\nIn tracts of pasture sunny-warm,\nBeneath branch-work of costly sardonyx\nSat smiling, babe in arm.\n\nOr in a clear-wall'd city on the sea,\nNear gilded organ-pipes, her hair\nWound with white roses, slept St.\n\nCecily;\nAn angel look'd at her.\n\nOr thronging all one porch of Paradise\nA group of Houris bow'd to see\nThe dying Islamite, with hands and eyes\nThat said, We wait for thee.\n\nOr mythic Uther's deeply-wounded son\nIn some fair space of sloping greens\nLay, dozing in the vale of Avalon,\nAnd watch'd by weeping queens.\n\nOr hollowing one hand against his ear,\nTo list a foot-fall, ere he saw\nThe wood-nymph, stay'd the Ausonian king to hear\nOf wisdom and of law.\n\nOr over hills with peaky tops engrail'd,\nAnd many a tract of palm and rice,\nThe throne of Indian Cama slowly sail'd\nA summer fann'd with spice.\n\nOr sweet Europa's mantle blew unclasp'd,\nFrom off her shoulder backward borne:\nFrom one hand droop'd a crocus: one hand grasp'd\nThe mild bull's golden horn.\n\nOr else flush'd Ganymede, his rosy thigh\nHalf-buried in the Eagle's down,\nSole as a flying star shot thro' the sky\nAbove the pillar'd town.\n\nNor these alone; but every legend fair\nWhich the supreme Caucasian mind\nCarved out of Nature for itself, was there,\nNot less than life, design'd.\n\nThen in the towers I placed great bells that swung,\nMoved of themselves, with silver sound;\nAnd with choice paintings of wise men I hung\nThe royal dais round.\n\nFor there was Milton like a seraph strong,\nBeside him Shakespeare bland and mild;\nAnd there the world-worn Dante grasp'd his song,\nAnd somewhat grimly smiled.\n\nAnd there the Ionian father of the rest;\nA million wrinkles carved his skin;\nA hundred winters snow'd upon his breast,\nFrom cheek and throat and chin.\n\nAbove, the fair hall-ceiling stately-set\nMany an arch high up did lift,\nAnd angels rising and descending met\nWith interchange of gift.\n\nBelow was all mosaic choicely plann'd\nWith cycles of the human tale\nOf this wide world, the times of every land\nSo wrought, they will not fail.\n\nThe people here, a beast of burden slow,\nToil'd onward, prick'd with goads and stings;\nHere play'd, a tiger, rolling to and fro\nThe heads and crowns of kings;\nHere rose, an athlete, strong to break or bind\nAll force in bonds that might endure,\nAnd here once more like some sick man declined,\nAnd trusted any cure.\n\nBut over these she trod: and those great bells\nBegan to chime.\n\nShe took her throne:\nShe sat betwixt the shining Oriels,\nTo sing her songs alone.\n\nAnd thro' the topmost Oriels' coloured flame\nTwo godlike faces gazed below;\nPlato the wise, and large brow'd Verulam,\nThe first of those who know.\n\nAnd all those names, that in their motion were\nFull-welling fountain-heads of change,\nBetwixt the slender shafts were blazon'd fair\nIn diverse raiment strange:\nThro' which the lights, rose, amber, emerald, blue,\nFlush'd in her temples and her eyes,\nAnd from her lips, as morn from Memnon, drew\nRivers of melodies.\n\nNo nightingale delighteth to prolong\nHer low preamble all alone,\nMore than my soul to hear her echo'd song\nThrob thro' the ribbed stone;\nSinging and murmuring in her feastful mirth,\nJoying to feel herself alive,\nLord over Nature, Lord of the visible earth,\nLord of the senses five;\nCommuning with herself: \"All these are mine,\nAnd let the world have peace or wars,\n'T is one to me.\n\n\" She\u2014when young night divine\nCrown'd dying day with stars,\nMaking sweet close of his delicious toils\u2014\nLit light in wreaths and anadems,\nAnd pure quintessences of precious oils\nIn hollow'd moons of gems,\nTo mimic heaven; and clapt her hands and cried,\n\"I marvel if my still delight\nIn this great house so royal-rich, and wide,\nBe flatter'd to the height.\n\n\"O all things fair to sate my various eyes!\nO shapes and hues that please me well!\nO silent faces of the Great and Wise,\nMy Gods, with whom I dwell!\n\"O God-like isolation which art mine,\nI can but count thee perfect gain,\nWhat time I watch the darkening droves of swine\nThat range on yonder plain.\n\n\"In filthy sloughs they roll a prurient skin,\nThey graze and wallow, breed and sleep;\nAnd oft some brainless devil enters in,\nAnd drives them to the deep.\n\nThen of the moral instinct would she prate\nAnd of the rising from the dead,\nAs hers by right of full accomplish'd Fate;\nAnd at the last she said:\n\"I take possession of man's mind and deed.\n\nI care not what the sects may brawl.\n\nI sit as God holding no form of creed,\nBut contemplating all.\n\nFull oft the riddle of the painful earth\nFlash'd thro' her as she sat alone,\nYet not the less held she her solemn mirth,\nAnd intellectual throne.\n\nAnd so she throve and prosper'd; so three years\nShe prosper'd: on the fourth she fell,\nLike Herod, when the shout was in his ears,\nStruck thro' with pangs of hell.\n\nLest she should fail and perish utterly,\nGod, before whom ever lie bare\nThe abysmal deeps of Personality,\nPlagued her with sore despair.\n\nWhen she would think, where'er she turn'd her sight\nThe airy hand confusion wrought,\nWrote, \"Mene, mene,\" and divided quite\nThe kingdom of her thought.\n\nDeep dread and loathing of her solitude\nFell on her, from which mood was born\nScorn of herself; again, from out that mood\nLaughter at her self-scorn.\n\n\"What! is not this my place of strength,\" she said,\n\"My spacious mansion built for me,\nWhereof the strong foundation-stones were laid\nSince my first memory?\n\nBut in dark corners of her palace stood\nUncertain shapes; and unawares\nOn white-eyed phantasms weeping tears of blood,\nAnd horrible nightmares,\nAnd hollow shades enclosing hearts of flame,\nAnd, with dim fretted foreheads all,\nOn corpses three-months-old at noon she came,\nThat stood against the wall.\n\nA spot of dull stagnation, without light\nOr power of movement, seem'd my soul,\n'Mid onward-sloping motions infinite\nMaking for one sure goal.\n\nA still salt pool, lock'd in with bars of sand,\nLeft on the shore, that hears all night\nThe plunging seas draw backward from the land\nTheir moon-led waters white.\n\nA star that with the choral starry dance\nJoin'd not, but stood, and standing saw\nThe hollow orb of moving Circumstance\nRoll'd round by one fix'd law.\n\nBack on herself her serpent pride had curl'd.\n\n\"No voice,\" she shriek'd in that lone hall,\n\"No voice breaks thro' the stillness of this world:\nOne deep, deep silence all!\"\nShe, mouldering with the dull earth's mouldering sod,\nInwrapt tenfold in slothful shame,\nLay there exiled from eternal God,\nLost to her place and name;\nAnd death and life she hated equally,\nAnd nothing saw, for her despair,\nBut dreadful time, dreadful eternity,\nNo comfort anywhere;\nRemaining utterly confused with fears,\nAnd ever worse with growing time,\nAnd ever unrelieved by dismal tears,\nAnd all alone in crime:\nShut up as in a crumbling tomb, girt round\nWith blackness as a solid wall,\nFar off she seem'd to hear the dully sound\nOf human footsteps fall.\n\nAs in strange lands a traveller walking slow,\nIn doubt and great perplexity,\nA little before moon-rise hears the low\nMoan of an unknown sea;\nAnd knows not if it be thunder, or a sound\nOf rocks thrown down, or one deep cry\nOf great wild beasts; then thinketh, \"I have found\nA new land, but I die.\n\nShe howl'd aloud, \"I am on fire within.\n\nThere comes no murmur of reply.\n\nWhat is it that will take away my sin,\nAnd save me lest I die?\n\nSo when four years were wholly finished,\nShe threw her royal robes away.\n\n\"Make me a cottage in the vale,\" she said,\n\"Where I may mourn and pray.\n\n\"Yet pull not down my palace towers, that are\nSo lightly, beautifully built:\nPerchance I may return with others there\nWhen I have purged my guilt.\n\nNOTES\nForm:\nabab\n\n\nProvide classifications for the following 28 fields:\n\nHISTORICAL:\n- period\n- literary_movement\n\nRHETORICAL:\n- register\n- rhetorical_genre\n- discursive_structure\n- discourse_type\n- narrative_level\n- diegetic_mimetic\n- focalization\n- person\n- deictic_orientation\n- addressee_type\n- deictic_object\n- temporal_orientation\n- temporal_structure\n- tradition\n\nFORMAL:\n- mode\n- genre\n- stanza_structure\n- meter\n- rhyme\n\nFormat your response as:\nperiod: [value]\nliterary_movement: [value]\n...

(Dante)\nImmaginata guida la conduce.\n\n(Petrarch)\nI dream of you to wake: would that I might\nDream of you and not wake but slumber on;\nNor find with dreams the dear companion gone,\nAs summer ended summer birds take flight.\n\nIn happy dreams I hold you full in sight,\nI blush again who waking look so wan;\nBrighter than sunniest day that ever shone,\nIn happy dreams your smile makes day of night.\n\nThus only in a dream we are at one,\nThus only in a dream we give and take\nThe faith that maketh rich who take or give;\nIf thus to sleep is sweeter than to wake,\nTo die were surely sweeter than to live,\nThough there be nothing new beneath the sun.\n\n4\nPoca favilla gran fliamma seconda.\n\n(Dante)\nOgni altra cosa, ogni pensier va fore,\nE sol ivi con voi rimansi amore.\n\n(Petrarch)\nI loved you first: but afterwards your love\nOutsoaring mine, sang such a loftier song\nAs drowned the friendly cooings of my dove.\n\nWhich owes the other most?\n\nMy love was long,\nAnd yours one moment seemed to wax more strong;\nI loved and guessed at you, you construed me -\nAnd loved me for what might or might not be\nNay, weights and measures do us both a wrong.\n\nFor verily love knows not \u2018mine\u2019 or \u2018thine;\u2019\nWith separate \u2018I\u2019 and \u2018thou\u2019 free love has done,\nFor one is both and both are one in love:\nRich love knows nought of \u2018thine that is not mine;\u2019\nBoth have the strength and both the length thereof,\nBoth of us, of the love which makes us one.\n\n5\nAmor che a nullo amato amar perdona.\n\n(Dante)\nAmor m'addusse in s\u00ec gioiosa spene.\n\n(Petrarch)\nO my heart's heart, and you who are to me\nMore than myself myself, God be with you,\nKeep you in strong obedience leal and true\nTo Him whose noble service setteth free,\nGive you all good we see or can foresee,\nMake your joys many and your sorrows few,\nBless you in what you bear and what you do,\nYea, perfect you as He would have you be.\n\nSo much for you; but what for me, dear friend?\n\nTo love you without stint and all I can\nToday, tomorrow, world without an end;\nTo love you much and yet to love you more,\nAs Jordan at his flood sweeps either shore;\nSince woman is the helpmeet made for man.\n\n6\nOr puoi la quantitate\nComprender de l'amor che a te mi scalda.\n\n(Dante)\nNon vo' che da tal nodo mi scioglia.\n\n(Petrarch)\nTrust me, I have not earned your dear rebuke,\nI love, as you would have me, God the most;\nWould lose not Him, but you, must one be lost,\nNor with Lot's wife cast back a faithless look\nUnready to forego what I forsook;\nThis say I, having counted up the cost,\nThis, though I be the feeblest of God's host,\nThe sorriest sheep Christ shepherds with His crook.\n\nYet while I love my God the most, I deem\nThat I can never love you overmuch;\nI love Him more, so let me love you too;\nYea, as I apprehend it, love is such\nI cannot love you if I love not Him,\nI cannot love Him if I love not you.\n\n7\nQui primavera sempre ed ogni frutto.\n\n(Dante)\nRagionando con meco ed io con lui.\n\n(Petrarch)\n\u2018Love me, for I love you\u2019 - and answer me,\n\u2018Love me, for I love you\u2019 - so shall we stand\nAs happy equals in the flowering land\nOf love, that knows not a dividing sea.\n\nLove builds the house on rock and not on sand,\nLove laughs what while the winds rave desperately;\nAnd who hath found love's citadel unmanned?\n\nAnd who hath held in bonds love's liberty?\n\nMy heart's a coward though my words are brave\nWe meet so seldom, yet we surely part\nSo often; there's a problem for your art!\nStill I find comfort in his Book, who saith,\nThough jealousy be cruel as the grave,\nAnd death be strong, yet love is strong as death.\n\n8\nCome dicesse a Dio: D'altro non calme.\n\n(Dante)\nSpero trovar piet\u00e0 non che perdono.\n\n(Petrarch)\n\u2018I, if I perish, perish\u2019 - Esther spake:\nAnd bride of life or death she made her fair\nIn all the lustre of her perfumed hair\nAnd smiles that kindle longing but to slake.\n\nShe put on pomp of loveliness, to take\nHer husband through his eyes at unaware;\nShe spread abroad her beauty for a snare,\nHarmless as doves and subtle as a snake.\n\nShe trapped him with one mesh of silken hair,\nShe vanquished him by wisdom of her wit,\nAnd built her people's house that it should stand: -\nIf I might take my life so in my hand,\nAnd for my love to Love put up my prayer,\nAnd for love's sake by Love be granted it!\n9\nO dignitosa coscienza e netta! (Dante)\nSpirto pi\u00f9 acceso di virtuti ardenti.\n\n(Petrarch)\nThinking of you, and all that was, and all\nThat might have been and now can never be,\nI feel your honoured excellence, and see\nMyself unworthy of the happier call:\nFor woe is me who walk so apt to fall,\nSo apt to shrink afraid, so apt to flee,\nApt to lie down and die (ah, woe is me!)\nFaithless and hopeless turning to the wall.\n\nAnd yet not hopeless quite nor faithless quite,\nBecause not loveless; love may toil all night,\nBut take at morning; wrestle till the break\nOf day, but then wield power with God and man: -\nSo take I heart of grace as best I can,\nReady to spend and be spent for your sake.\n\n10\nCon miglior corso e con migliore stella.\n\n(Dante)\nLa vita fugge e non s'arresta un' ora.\n\n(Petrarch)\nTime flies, hope flags, life plies a wearied wing;\nDeath following hard on life gains ground apace;\nFaith runs with each and rears an eager face,\nOutruns the rest, makes light of everything,\nSpurns earth, and still finds breath to pray and sing;\nWhile love ahead of all uplifts his praise,\nStill asks for grace and still gives thanks for grace,\nContent with all day brings and night will bring.\n\nLife wanes; and when love folds his wings above\nTired hope, and less we feel his conscious pulse,\nLet us go fall asleep, dear friend, in peace:\nA little while, and age and sorrow cease;\nA little while, and life reborn annuls\nLoss and decay and death, and all is love.\n\n11\nVien dietro a me e lascia dir le genti.\n\n(Dante)\nContando i casi della vita nostra.\n\n(Petrarch)\nMany in aftertimes will say of you\n\u2018He loved her\u2019 - while of me what will they say?\n\nNot that I loved you more than just in play,\nFor fashion's sake as idle women do.\n\nEven let them prate; who know not what we knew\nOf love and parting in exceeding pain,\nOf parting hopeless here to meet again,\nHopeless on earth, and heaven is out of view.\n\nBut by my heart of love laid bare to you,\nMy love that you can make not void nor vain,\nLove that foregoes you but to claim anew\nBeyond this passage of the gate of death,\nI charge you at the Judgment make it plain\nMy love of you was life and not a breath.\n\n12\nAmor, che ne la mente mi ragiona.\n\n(Dante)\nAmor vien nel bel viso di costei.\n\n(Petrarch)\nIf there be any one can take my place\nAnd make you happy whom I grieve to grieve,\nThink not that I can grudge it, but believe\nI do commend you to that nobler grace,\nThat readier wit than mine, that sweeter face;\nYea, since your riches make me rich, conceive\nI too am crowned, while bridal crowns I weave,\nAnd thread the bridal dance with jocund pace.\n\nFor if I did not love you, it might be\nThat I should grudge you some one dear delight;\nBut since the heart is yours that was mine own,\nYour pleasure is my pleasure, right my right,\nYour honourable freedom makes me free,\nAnd you companioned I am not alone.\n\n13\nE drizzeremo gli occhi al Primo Amore.\n\n(Dante)\nMa trovo peso non da le mie braccia.\n\n(Petrarch)\nIf I could trust mine own self with your fate,\nShall I not rather trust it in God's hand?\n\nWithout Whose Will one lily doth not stand,\nNor sparrow fall at his appointed date;\nWho numbereth the innumerable sand,\nWho weighs the wind and water with a weight,\nTo Whom the world is neither small nor great,\nWhose knowledge foreknew every plan we planned.\n\nSearching my heart for all that touches you,\nI find there only love and love's goodwill\nHelpless to help and impotent to do,\nOf understanding dull, of sight most dim;\nAnd therefore I commend you back to Him\nWhose love your love's capacity can fill.\n\n14\nE la Sua Volontade \u00e8 nostra pace.\n\n(Dante)\nSol con questi pensier, con altre chiome.\n\n(Petrarch)\nYouth gone, and beauty gone if ever there\nDwelt beauty in so poor a face as this;\nYouth gone and beauty, what remains of bliss?\n\nI will not bind fresh roses in my hair,\nTo shame a cheek at best but little fair, -\nLeave youth his roses, who can bear a thorn, -\nI will not seek for blossoms anywhere,\nExcept such common flowers as blow with corn.\n\nYouth gone and beauty gone, what doth remain?\n\nThe longing of a heart pent up forlorn,\nA silent heart whose silence loves and longs;\nThe silence of a heart which sang its songs\nWhile youth and beauty made a summer morn,\nSilence of love that cannot sing again.\n\nProvide classifications for the following 28 fields:\n\nHISTORICAL:\n- period\n- literary_movement\n\nRHETORICAL:\n- register\n- rhetorical_genre\n- discursive_structure\n- discourse_type\n- narrative_level\n- diegetic_mimetic\n- focalization\n- person\n- deictic_orientation\n- addressee_type\n- deictic_object\n- temporal_orientation\n- temporal_structure\n- tradition\n\nFORMAL:\n- mode\n- genre\n- stanza_structure\n- meter\n- rhyme\n\nFormat your response as:\nperiod: [value]\nliterary_movement: [value]\n...

interjections\nThe sun beats lightning on the waves,\nThe waves fold thunder on the sand;\nAnd could they hear me I would tell them:\n\nO brilliant kids, frisk with your dog,\nFondle your shells and sticks, bleached\nBy time and the elements; but there is a line\nYou must not cross nor ever trust beyond it\nSpry cordage of your bodies to caresses\nToo lichen-faithful from too wide a breast.\n\nThe bottom of the sea is cruel.\n\nII\n\n\u2014And yet this great wink of eternity,\nOf rimless floods, unfettered leewardings,\nSamite sheeted and processioned where\nHer undinal vast belly moonward bends,\nLaughing the wrapt inflections of our love;\n\nTake this Sea, whose diapason knells\nOn scrolls of silver snowy sentences,\nThe sceptred terror of whose sessions rends\nAs her demeanors motion well or ill,\nAll but the pieties of lovers\u2019 hands.\n\nAnd onward, as bells off San Salvador\nSalute the crocus lustres of the stars,\nIn these poinsettia meadows of her

of sorts.\n\nThe day was green.\n\nThey said, 'You have a blue guitar,\nYou do not play things as they are.\n\nThe man replied, 'Things as they are\nAre changed upon the blue guitar.\n\nAnd they said then, 'But play, you must,\nA tune beyond us, yet ourselves,\nA tune upon the blue guitar\nOf things exactly as they are.\n\nII\nI cannot bring a world quite round,\nAlthough I patch it as I can.\n\nI sing a hero's head, large eye\nAnd bearded bronze, but not a man,\nAlthough I patch him as I can\nAnd reach through him almost to man.\n\nIf to serenade almost to man\nIs to miss, by that, things as they are,\nSay it is the serenade\nOf a man that plays a blue guitar.\n\nIII\nAh, but to play man number one,\nTo drive the dagger in his heart,\nTo lay his brain upon the board\nAnd pick the acrid colors out,\nTo nail his thought across the door,\nIts wings spread wide to rain and snow,\nTo strike his living hi and ho,\nTo tick it, tock it, turn it true,\nTo bang from it a savage blue,\nJangling the metal of the strings\nIV\nSo that's life, then: things as they are?\n\nIt picks its way on the blue guitar.\n\nA million people on one string?\n\nAnd all their manner in the thing,\nAnd all their manner, right and wrong,\nAnd all their manner, weak and strong?\n\nThe feelings crazily, craftily call,\nLike a buzzing of flies in autumn air,\nAnd that's life, then: things as they are,\nThis buzzing of the blue guitar.\n\nV\nDo not speak to us of the greatness of poetry,\nOf the torches wisping in the underground,\nOf the structure of vaults upon a point of light.\n\nThere are no shadows in our sun,\nDay is desire and night is sleep.\n\nThere are no shadows anywhere.\n\nThe earth, for us, is flat and bare.\n\nThere are no shadows.\n\nPoetry\nExceeding music must take the place\nOf empty heaven and its hymns,\nOurselves in poetry must take their place,\nEven in the chattering of your guitar.\n\nVI\nA tune beyond us as we are,\nYet nothing changed by the blue guitar;\nOurselves in the tune as if in space,\nYet nothing changed, except the place\nOf things as they are and only the place\nAs you play them, on the blue guitar,\nPlaced, so, beyond the compass of change,\nPerceived in a final atmosphere;\nFor a moment final, in the way\nThe thinking of art seems final when\nThe thinking of god is smoky dew.\n\nThe tune is space.\n\nThe blue guitar\nBecomes the place of things as they are,\nA composing of senses of the guitar.\n\nVII\nIt is the sun that shares our works.\n\nThe moon shares nothing.\n\nIt is a sea.\n\nWhen shall I come to say of the sun,\nIt is a sea; it shares nothing;\nThe sun no longer shares our works\nAnd the earth is alive with creeping men,\nMechanical beetles never quite warm?\n\nAnd shall I then stand in the sun, as now\nI stand in the moon, and call it good,\nThe immaculate, the merciful good,\nDetached from us, from things as they are?\n\nNot to be part of the sun?\n\nTo stand\nRemote and call it merciful?\n\nThe strings are cold on the blue guitar.\n\nVIII\nThe vivid, florid, turgid sky,\nThe drenching thunder rolling by,\nThe morning deluged still by night,\nThe clouds tumultuously bright\nAnd the feeling heavy in cold chords\nStruggling toward impassioned choirs,\nCrying among the clouds, enraged\nBy gold antagonists in air-\nI know my lazy, leaden twang\nIs like the reason in a storm;\nAnd yet it brings the storm to bear.\n\nI twang it out and leave it there.\n\nIX\nAnd the color, the overcast blue\nOf the air, in which the blue guitar\nIs a form, described but difficult,\nAnd I am merely a shadow hunched\nAbove the arrowy, still strings,\nThe maker of a thing yet to be made;\nThe color like a thought that grows\nOut of a mood, the tragic robe\nOf the actor, half his gesture, half\nHis speech, the dress of his meaning, silk\nSodden with his melancholy words,\nThe weather of his stage, himself.\n\nX\nRaise reddest columns.\n\nToll a bell\nAnd clap the hollows full of tin.\n\nThrow papers in the streets, the wills\nOf the dead, majestic in their seals.\n\nAnd the beautiful trombones-behold\nThe approach of him whom none believes,\nWhom all believe that all believe,\nA pagan in a varnished care.\n\nRoll a drum upon the blue guitar.\n\nLean from the steeple.\n\nCry aloud,\n'Here am I, my adversary, that\nConfront you, hoo-ing the slick trombones,\nYet with a petty misery\nAt heart, a petty misery,\nEver the prelude to your end,\nThe touch that topples men and rock.\n\nXV\nIs this picture of Picasso's, this 'hoard\nOf destructions', a picture of ourselves,\nNow, an image of our society?\n\nDo I sit, deformed, a naked egg,\nCatching at Good-bye, harvest moon,\nWithout seeing the harvest or the moon?\n\nThings as they are have been destroyed.\n\nHave I?\n\nAm I a man that is dead\nAt a table on which the food is cold?\n\nIs my thought a memory, not alive?\n\nIs the spot on the floor, there, wine or blood\nAnd whichever it may be, is it mine?\n\nXXIII\nA few final solutions, like a duet\nWith the undertaker: a voice in the clouds,\nAnother on earth, the one a voice\nOf ether, the other smelling of drink,\nThe voice of ether prevailing, the swell\nOf the undertaker's song in the snow\nApostrophizing wreaths, the voice\nIn the clouds serene and final, next\nThe grunted breath scene and final,\nThe imagined and the real, thought\nAnd the truth, Dichtung und Wahrheit, all\nConfusion solved, as in a refrain\nOne keeps on playing year by year,\nConcerning the nature of things as they are.\n\nXXX\nFrom this I shall evolve a man.\n\nThis is his essence: the old fantoche\nHanging his shawl upon the wind,\nLike something on the stage, puffed out,\nHis strutting studied through centuries.\n\nAt last, in spite of his manner, his eye\nA-cock at the cross-piece on a pole\nSupporting heavy cables, slung\nThrough Oxidia, banal suburb,\nOne-half of all its installments paid.\n\nDew-dapper clapper-traps, blazing\nFrom crusty stacks above machines.\n\nEcce, Oxidia is the seed\nDropped out of this amber-ember pod,\nOxidia is the soot of fire,\nOxidia is Olympia.\n\nXXXI\nHow long and late the pheasant sleeps\nThe employer and employee contend,\nCombat, compose their droll affair.\n\nThe bubbling sun will bubble up,\nSpring sparkle and the cock-bird shriek.\n\nThe employer and employee will hear\nAnd continue their affair.\n\nThe shriek\nWill rack the thickets.\n\nThere is no place,\nHere, for the lark fixed in the mind,\nIn the museum of the sky.\n\nThe cock\nWill claw sleep.\n\nMorning is not sun,\nIt is this posture of the nerves,\nAs if a blunted player clutched\nThe nuances of the blue guitar.\n\nIt must be this rhapsody or none,\nThe rhapsody of things as they are.\n\nXXXII\nThrow away the lights, the definitions,\nAnd say of what you see in the dark\nThat it is this or that it is that,\nBut do not use the rotted names.\n\nHow should you walk in that space and know\nNothing of the madness of space,\nNothing of its jocular procreations?\n\nThrow the lights away.\n\nNothing must stand\nBetween you and the shapes you take\nWhen the crust of shape has been destroyed.\n\nYou as you are?\n\nYou are yourself.\n\nThe blue guitar surprises you.\n\nXXXIII\nThat generation's dream, aviled\nIn the mud, in Monday's dirty light,\nThat's it, the only dream they knew,\nTime in its final block, not time\nTo come, a wrangling of two dreams.\n\nHere is the bread of time to come,\nHere is its actual stone.\n\nThe bread\nWill be our bread, the stone will be\nOur bed and we shall sleep by night.\n\nWe shall forget by day, except\nThe moments when we choose to play\nThe imagined pine, the imagined jay.\n\n\nProvide classifications for the following 28 fields:\n\nHISTORICAL:\n- period\n-
