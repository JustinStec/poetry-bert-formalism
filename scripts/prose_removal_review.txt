   3: "Delightful are trees and fields with the outgrowth of new tender-leaves and crops, Lodhra trees are with their blossomy flowers, crops of rice are completely ripened, but now lotuses are on their surcease by far, for the dewdrops are falling… hence, this is the time of pre-winter that drew nigh…
   4: "The busts of flirtatious women that are graced by bosomy bosoms are bedaubed and reddened with the redness of heart-stealing saffrony skincare, called Kashmir kumkum, on which embellished are the white pendants that are in shine with the whiteness of whitish dewdrops, white jasmines, and whitely moon…
   5: "Undecorated are the hiplines of kittenish women with gem-studded golden strings of girdle, nor their lotus like feet that have the brightness of lotuses with jingling anklets, whose jingling is correlative to the clucks of swans, for the cold touch of coldish metal gives cold quivers…
   6: "Unbearable is the touch of metallic circlets on wrists and bicep-lets on upper-arms of the couple of arms of vivacious women, or the touch of new silk cloths on the discoid of their waistline, or fine fabric on their robust breasts…
   7: "The womenfolk are rubbing fragrant wood-turmeric powder on their bodies, and their lotus-like faces are tattooed with erasable tattoos of foliage, and their head-hair is fumigated with the fumes of aloe vera resin, and they are doing all this for merrymaking in an enjoyable lovemaking…
   8: "Thoughgood fortune is bechanced in the happiness of lovemaking, the women of age are with sallowish and whitened faces owing to the strain of lovemaking, and though they want to laugh heartily, they desist from it, noticing very painful lower lips that are bitten with the edges of teeth of their lovers in lovemaking, lest the lip is lengthened, the pain is sharpened…
   9: "On reaching the valleys of bosomy busts of women of age, the winter breeze is attaining their coolant splendidness, but when those bosoms are pressingly hugged by their lovers it is incarcerated there with an unable pain, and that pain is expressed by the Hemanta season, as though it is bewailing for a release of that breeze at least at dawn time, with tear-like dewdrops clinging on to the spires of grass-blades…
  10: "Overspread with abundant rice crops and ornamented with herds of she-deer, and delightfully reverberated by the ruddy geese, with their calls and counter-calls, the complacent corridors of confines are captivating hearts…
  11: "Now the lakes are adorned with fully blossomed black-lotuses, and elaborated with swan-like waterfowls in their excitement, and sheeted with considerably coldish waters that are depurated, thus these lakes are stealing the hearts of men, for men look up to them as the visages of women that are with black-lotus-like hairdo, with swanlike eyes, and whose bodies are cold, wanting a warm hug…
  12: "Oh, dear, the Priyangu plants that give fragrant seeds are ripened by the snow caused coldness, and they are frequently wobbled by the snowy winds, and they now appear like the fragrant and frisky women gone into paleness and wobbliness by their dissociation from their lovers…
  13: "These days the mouths of people are fragranced with the fragrance of liquors made from the essential oils of flowers, and their bodies are fragrant with the same fragrancy by their puffs of suspires, and while lying on beds jointly with their bodies in tight embrace, they are slipping into sleep, entwined with the essence of passion…
  14: "The young and beautiful ladies that are new to their adulthood have bruises and marks of teeth notches on their lips, and even their bosoms are incised with nails of their lovers, thus these marks and incisions clearly indicate that they have enjoyed lovemaking consummately…
  15: "Some woman of age staying in the warmth of tender sun to warm up herself, is holding a mirror and applying cosmetics on her lotus-like face, and while doing so, she is pouting her lips and examining them that are dented with teeth bites of her lover, whose quintessence is guzzled down by her lover in last night…
  16: "One more woman whose body is fatigued by the strain of excessive lovemaking, and who is quiet sleepless last night, and whose eyes are palish like white lotuses, and whose bun is slithered and plaits of head-hair are loosened and hair tousling on her shoulders, bust, and on her bosoms, is tripping into sleep, warmed up by the rays of tender sun…
  17: "Bedraggled are the loose ends of cloudlike blackish head-hair onto the lofty busty bosoms of some other slender-bodied women of age, by which busty weight crouching are their bodies, as slim pearly pendants would crouch onto their bosoms, and they are taking away the circlets of flowers from their hairdos, as those flowers are already utilised and devoid of their heart-pleasing fragrance of yester night, and now they are grooming their hair, afresh…
  18: "On examining her body that is completely enjoyed by her lover, another woman is highly gladdened, and she remade her pleasant lips resplendently with lip-colouring, and on examining her bust with nail scratches, she embarrassedly wore her bodice, and while doing so the pain of friction of bodice with nail-scratches made her eyes to twitch, on which eyes dangling are her dark, delicate, and twitchy hair-curls…
  19: "By the exertion in their long-lasting games of lovemaking other women of age are wearied, and their slim bodies are thrilling at their flanks from bosoms to thighs, thereby those prettily pretty women are applying bodily oils and pastes to take an oil bath, that relieves these tingling sensations…
  20: "Pleasant with many an attribute, stealer of the hearts of women, and at which time the confines of villages are overspread with many an abundant rice-crop on earth, and overlaid is the sky with the garlanded flights of ruddy gees, that which is always with a heart-stealing environ, such as it is, let this season Hemanta, pre-winter, endow comfort to all of you passionate people…

   3: "Oh, dear with best thighs, heart-stealing is this environ with abundantly grown stacks of rice and their cobs, or with sugarcane, and it is reverberated with the screeches of ruddy gees that abide hither and thither… now heightened will be passion, thereby this season will be gladdening for lusty womenfolk, hence listen of this season, called Shishira, the Winter…
   4: "At this time, people enjoy abiding in the medial places of their residences, whose ventilators are blockaded for the passage of chilly air, and at fireplaces, in sunrays, with heavy clothing, and along with mature women of age, for they too will be passionately steamy…
   5: "Presently, not the sandal-paste, which will be coolant like moonbeams of moon, nor the building tops, that were once rendered pleasant with the immaculate moonshine, nor the breezes, that are chilled by dense sleet… any of them is delightful for the people…
   6: "The nights are unenjoyable for the people, for they are chilled with the huddles of snow, and further chilled by moonbeams of the moon, besides, these nights are ornamented very whitish clusters of cluttered and lacklustre stars…
   7: "On taking betel leaves and their enclosing material like lime and areca-nut parings, and other fragrant material for chewing, and even handling body creams and tassels of flowers, for it is cool to wear them on, and with their lotus-like faces that are fragranced with delightful recreational drinks, the women are enthusiastically entering their bedchambers, that are desirably fragranced with the fumigation of aloe vera resin…
   8: "On entering bedchambers seen are the irritant husbands irritating for the arrival of their wives, but once these husbands were at fault and they were daunted repeatedly earlier, hence they are now wavery, for their hearts are ciphered by their hesitation, and on looking at such husbands, who are now longing for lovemaking, the lustful women are overlooking their faults, lest time and opportunity fritters away… thus this season unites couples, though they are at loggerheads…
   9: "The women that are new to adulthood are relentlessly gratified for a long time in longish nights, by young men who are muchly impassioned and lusting for their women, thus these young women after the end of night are moving about sluggishly in the morning, with their aching busts that are strained during last night's escapade…
  10: "The womenfolk's breasts are tightly bound by breast-bands thus they are squeezy, and on them the upper fringe of their colourful silk wraparound is wrapped, and such busts are ornamented, and in their hairdo interposed are flowers, thus those women are delightful and it appears that they themselves are embellishing the wintry season as its ornaments…
  11: "Nowadays the chests of lustful men are ocherish for they are rubbed against bosoms of their flirtatious women, whose busts are adorned with vermilion coloured skincare, and which young women are befitting for a comfortable close self-indulgence, for they are new to adulthood, and have warmish bosoms, and the men are sleeping while overly pressing the bosoms of their ladyloves against their own, thus the men are brazening out the chilling coldness of winter, and thus the women of age have an edge on the frostiness of this season…
  12: "In nights the gladdened women of age, desirous of lovemaking are consuming best, heart-stealing, excitant, and stimulant hard drinks along with their lovers, in which drinks lotus petal are placed for fragrance, and which lotus petals are undulated by the richly scented lusty suspirations of those women…
  13: "In the morning, one woman on getting rid of her penchant of passion, examined her own body, and observed that her nipples are subdued by her lover's embrace, and thus concluding that her body is completely enjoyed by her lover, she is going out of the bedchamber to another chamber, laughingly…
  14: "At dawn, another charmingly delightful and attractive woman, whose rumps are heavy and whose waistline is slender, on joggling the ends of her slithered hair plaits from which discarded are the circlets of flowers, that adorned her bun last night but now withered, and on furling up that hair which is fragrant, for it was fumigated with the resin of aloe vera during last night, is leaving the bed…
  15: "With their discoid faces that look like golden lotuses, cleansed just with water, and with their wide and medially whitish eyes, whose edges touch the edges of ears, and with their just cleansed hair dangling and clasping their shoulders, those women of age are snugly in the heart of their houses in these days, and they appear to be many a personified prosperity, Goddess Lakshmi-s, amidst Her golden lotuses…
  16: "Other women of age, uneasy with the weight of their beamy behinds, a little bent down at waist by the weight of their breasts, which weight of breasts and behinds is making them to walk slowly and slowly, but they are quickly disrobing themselves of their night-time and love-time getups, and enrobing themselves with the getups befitting for daytime…
  17: "On observing the areas of their bosoms that are puckered at their tops with edges of nails of their lovers during last night, and while touching the teeth-cracked tender-leaf like lower lips with their tongues, those women of age are rejoicing, for all this is according to their sought-after delectation, thus they are applying makeup on their faces, at the dawn time of the sun, that rejoicingly…
  18: "In this season, abundant are the new sugar-candies and their modified sweetmeats, new rice is relishable, juice of new sugar-cane is delightful, intensified will be the disport of lovemaking, for the self-conceit of Love-god occasions anew, but this season alone will be the cause for scorching the hearts of those that are devoid of their loved ones, and thus let this winter season be always there for your propitiousness…

 151: The poem to which the above was written, as an answer, has, I believe, been long since forgotten; and as the author was acknowledged to be a very worthy and respectable man, though a very bad poet, his shame should be forgotten also.
 152: 
 153: The satire is therefore published without the name of the author, and thus it is hoped, some instruction to other writers, and some diversion to the reader my be gathered from it, without injuring the feelings of any person whatever.
 154: 
 155: Those who have read the work alluded to, (which the reader will observe, was printed many years ago with no name annexed,) will judge for themselves, whether its sentence here pronounced, was just or not; and those who never have, and probably never will, may consider the answer as a description of bad poetry in general, in which light it is now given to the world, and may be serviceable in restraining those who scribble prophanely or indecently, without the skill to compose verse, or sense to entertain their readers.

 579: 
 580: ' Independently of his other singular accomplishments, James particularly excelled in music, not only as a performer, but a composer: and it is to his admirable genius, that the musical world is so much indebted for the invention (amidst the gloom of solitude and confinement) of that sweet and plaintive Scotch and Italian melody, which, as the above mentioned author, justly remarks, 'has given pleasure to millions in every succeeding age.
 581: 
 582: Alexandro Tassoni mentions James king of Scotland, having, of himself, invented a new kind of music, plaintive and melancholy, different from all others, in which he was imitated by Carlo Gesualdo, prince of Venosa, who in our age (says Parsoni) has improved music with new and admirable inventions.
 583:

 336: 
 337: But the Swiss are so intoxicated with this tune, that if at any time they hear it when abroad in foreign service, they burst into tears; and often fall sick, and even die, of a passionate desire to revisit their native country; for which reason, in some armies where they serve, the playing of this tune is prohibited.
 338: 
 339: This tune having been the attendant of their childhood and early youth, recals to their memory those regions of wild beauty and rude magnificence; those days of liberty and peace; those nights of festivity; those happy assemblies; those tender passions, which formerly endeared to them their country, their homes, and their employments; and which, when compared with the scenes of uproar they are now engaged in, and the servitude they now undergo, awaken such regret as entirely overpowers them.

 373: 
 374: Impressed with the baneful consequences inseparable from an inordinate use of ardent spirits among the lower orders of society, and anxious to contribute something that might at least tend to retard the contagion of so dangerous an evil; it was conceived in the ardor of philanthropy, that a natural, pathetic story, in verse, calculated to enforce moral truths, in the language of simplicity and passion, might probably interest the uncorrupted; and that a striking picture of the calamities incident to idle debauchery, contrasted with the blessings of industrious prosperity, might (although insufficient to reclaim abandoned vice) do something to strengthen and encourage endangered virtue.

 381: 
 382: A more lively, and more pleasing recollection of virtues, which are superior to all that literature or talents can bestow, inclines me, however, to think, that indifferent as you have long been, to the 'obstreperous trump of fame,' the 'still small voice of gratitude' and esteem will not be unpleasant to your ear; and that you will believe me to be, without farther profession,

   3: Yesterday I found my pipe while pondering a long evening of work, of fine winter work.
   4: 
   5: Thrown aside were my cigarettes, with all the childish joys of summer, into the past which the leaves shining blue in the sun, the muslins, illuminate, and taken up once again was the grave pipe of a serious man who wants to smoke for a long while without being disturbed, so as better to work: but I was not prepared for the surprise that this abandoned object had in store for me; for hardly had I drawn the first puff when I forgot the grand books I was planning to write, and, amazed, moved to a feeling of tenderness, I breathed in the air of the previous winter which was now coming back to me.
   6: 
   7: I had not been in contact with my faithful sweetheart since returning to France, and now all of London, London as I had lived it a year ago entirely alone, appeared before my eyes: first the dear fogs that muffle one’s brains and have an odor of their own there when they penetrate beneath the casements.
   8: 
   9: My tobacco had the scent of a somber room with leather furniture sprinkled by coal dust, on which the thin black cat would curl and stretch; the big fires! and the maid with red arms pouring coals, and the noise of those coals falling from the sheet-iron bucket into the iron scuttle in the morning—when the postman gave the solemn double knock that kept me alive! Once again I saw through the windows those sickly trees of the deserted square—I saw the open sea, crossed so often that winter, shivering on the deck of the steamer wet with drizzle and blackened from the fumes—with my poor wandering beloved, decked out in traveller’s clothes, a long dress, dull as the dust of the roads, a coat clinging damply to her cold shoulders, one of those straw hats with no feather and hardly any ribbons that wealthy ladies throw away upon arrival, mangled as they are by the sea, and that poor loved ones refurbish for many another season.
  10: 
  11: Around her neck was wound the terrible handkerchief that one waves when saying goodbye forever.

  10: By alone I mean without a material being, and my cat is a mystic companion, a spirit.
  11: 
  12: I can say then that I have passed long days alone with my cat and alone with one of the last authors of the Roman decadence; for since the white creature is no more I have loved, uniquely and strangely, everything summed up in the word: fall.
  13: 
  14: So, in the year, my favourite season is the last slow part of summer that just precedes autumn, and, in the day, the hour when I walk is when the sun hesitates before vanishing, with rays of yellow bronze over the grey walls, and rays of red copper over the tiles.
  15: 
  16: Literature, also, from which my spirit asks voluptuousness, that will be the agonised poetry of Rome’s last moments, so long as it does not breathe a breath of the reinvigorated stance of the Barbarians or stammer in childish Latin like Christian prose.
  17: 
  18: I was reading then one of those dear poems (whose flakes of rouge have more charm for me than young flesh), and dipping a hand into the pure animal fur, when a street organ sounded languishingly and sadly under my window.

  96: The Lake of the Dead is not laid down, or not under that name, in any of the maps which I have seen; nor mentioned, so far as I am aware, in any book.
  97: 
  98: Maps and books, indeed, will readily be understood to pass without notice a multitude of lesser lakes, forming part of the extended chain of waters through which the route of the traveller is carried, and which exhibit every variety, from Lakes Superior, Huron, and Winnipeg, which may be called fresh-water inland seas, down to the clear pond embosomed in wooded hills which bears the name of Cold Lake,-- or among rivers, from the magnificent Ottawa to obscure and skulking streams, where you seem to be stealing your way along, as if to hide from pursuit, which barely afford passage for the canoe.

 101: 
 102: The Lake of the Dead, however, was not the subject of any such difference among our people.
 103:

 107: 
 108: The portage is also called the Portage des Morts, but, with little doubt, after the Lake.
 109: 
 110: We passed many whole days on the journey without getting a glimpse of even a solitary savage gliding by in his little canoe, or of a straggling half-naked family peeping out of the opening of the conical tent of bark-covered poles, among the trees; but in this part of the route we were five days and a half without encountering a single human being.

  45: 'Whatever may be the merits or demerits of these lines in other respects, I venture to say that the description of the falls and rainbow, as viewed about five o'clock on a bright afternoon in the end of July, is closely accurate and faithful.
  46: 
  47: The cataract, always  excepting Niagara, which stands alone and supreme, is by far the grandest and most striking which I have ever seen.
  48: 
  49: The summer of the fall exhibits, in a remarkable manner, what is observable in many of the streams of Canada, where they break over stones or rocks, that appearance which is described in an exquisite simile by the hand of Scott -- a master-hand, indeed, in portraying, with effect in every touch, at once the poetry and the vivid reality of the face of nature:
  50: Each wave was crested with tawny foam,
  51: Like the mane of a chesnut steed.
  52: 
  53: I should guess the fall to be not less than two hundred feet high.
  54: 
  55: The gentleman who travelled with me as my chaplain, first called my attention to a tremulousness in the whole atmosphere as we approached the fall, to which allusion is made in the first line.

  19: This arrangement, which was not without its pain to my feelings, was considered to be a work of necessity; for, independently of my having particular reasons for not prolonging my absence from the diocese, it had been so strongly represented to me that I must not attempt to cross Lake Superior on my return, after August, on account of the commencement of the windy season about the close of that month, as to induce me, conceiving that I had not a day to lose, to alter some public appointments of duty at Quebec, in order to set out a week earlier than the time which I had originally fixed.

  21: On Lake Superior itself, it is specially necessary, at all seasons, not to lose any favourable weather for proceeding,-- the liability of detention, in the case of travellers by canoe, being very great.

That o’er the channel reared, half way at sea The mariner at early morning hails, I would recline; while Fancy should go forth, And represent the strange and awful hour Of vast concussion; when the Omnipotent Stretched forth his arm, and rent the solid hills, Bidding the impetuous main flood rush between The rifted shores, and from the continent Eternally divided this green isle.

   5: Imperial lord of the high southern coast! From thy projecting head-land I would mark Far in the east the shades of night disperse, Melting and thinned, as from the dark blue wave Emerging, brilliant rays of arrowy light Dart from the horizon; when the glorious sun Just lifts above it his resplendent orb.

   7: Advances now, with feathery silver touched, The rippling tide of flood; glisten the sands, While, inmates of the chalky clefts that scar Thy sides precipitous, with shrill harsh cry, Their white wings glancing in the level beam, The terns, and gulls, and tarrocks, seek their food, And thy rough hollows echo to the voice Of the gray choughs, and ever restless daws, With clamor, not unlike the chiding hounds, While the lone shepherd, and his baying dog, Drive to thy turfy crest his bleating flock.

 154: 
 155: The moon was ex—libris of the nocturnal éxtasis, the stem of flower born of your own seed, solitude without the trees that maintain the sky, the delight ignoring to drink in your language, as the stone ignores the language of the bird.

   5: For one thing, it has none of the usual features which define a city of any size, and might be better described as a small town or village; an out-of-the-way place long gone to see.
   6: 
   7: Unlike cities both ancient and modern, the unholy city has never been marked on a map.
   8: 
   9: It is merely an ever changing name without a location, and is far more likely to find it's way to you, than you are to find your way to it - unless of course, you have been provided with special instructions that lead to an infinite barren landscape and end in the heart of nowhere.
  10: 
  11: As for the quality or characteristic of unholiness, this is also misleading, a nominal facade designed to make things interesting for a world born out of blackness, where nothing holy or unholy has ever existed, where nothing exists at all except dreams and fevers and names for nothing, the creations, so to speak, of that original blackness which pulls itself over every world like a hangman's hood over a condemned man's head.

  18: 
  19: And so few will ever seek to discover, and none of them will ever be allowed to tell, that we ourselves are the dark language in which the big news is forever being written.

   3: There are so many heads in the world, wherever you go there are heads, every day there are more of them sprouting up in the blackness.
   4: 
   5: At one time there was nothing at all, only blackness; and then, within the infinite space of that blackness things started to develop.
   6: 
   7: But as soon as those heads came along nothing much has happened - or nothing worthy of note: the whole world reached its peak and turned into an enormous heads factory.
   8: 
   9: Everyday there are more and more of them sprouting up in the blackness - which was there at the beginning - the blackness that, perhaps by chance, began to produce all these heads, and continues to produce so always calling out for more heads to carry out the business it wants done, its black voice roaring across the infinite black space of its heads factory.
  10: 
  11: But none of the heads has any ideas about the blackness that surrounds them or the blackness that hides itself inside each one of them.

   5: There is simply no avoiding it since everything has been designed to lead you to this place.
   6: 
   7: Any road may present a detour that unexpectedly sends you on your way into a great barren landscape where only a sliver of horizon wavers in the empty distance and no road signs exist to hint at your destination.
   8: 
   9: Any hospital may be equipped with the special elevator where someone wheels you inside and then quickly abandons you.
  10: 
  11: As the doors clamp tightly closed you finally notice that there are no buttons to push, no controls of any kind.
  12: 
  13: This is when the elevator begins to move, dipping and twisting like a carnival ride, taking you toward the Unholy City.
  14: 
  15: After enduring such episodes, or others of a similar sort, you may only wake up screaming, vowing to never again close your eyes in sleep.
  16: 
  17: Or you may fall into a fever that no thermometer is able to indicate and from which there is no recovery.
  18: 
  19: In more extreme cases you begin to glimpse a blackness like none you have ever seen, and wonder for a time whether this blackness is inside your head or outside, which makes no difference once it begins to compose the outline of the Unholy City you're about to enter.

   9: Although I did not understand a word they were saying,  their sound surrounded me, fell on my shoulders and hair,  and burst on my cheeks like kisses, and continued to fall,  holding me there where I stood on the sidewalk listening.

   5: They die suddenly, as if thrown from an airplane, or from spontaneous cardiac arrest.

   9: The milk was poisoned and forty-two babies died, she laughs, as she fondles the ashes of the dead books.
  10: 
  11: And the death of forty-two babies is equal in value to the death of this book which is equal in value to the ninety-year old woman who shot herself while the sheriff waited at her door with an eviction notice which is equal in value to the collapsing of the global economy which is equal to the military in country XYZ seizing the land of the semi-nomadic hunters and cultivators of crops who have lived in the local rain forest for thousands of years.
  12: 
  13: The reader opens a dead book and finds an infinite amount of burnt ash between the bindings, and when the ash blows in the wind the lipstick says that every death in the world is equal to every other death in the world which is equal to every birth in the world which is equal to every act of dismemberment which is equal to the death of a jungle which is equal to the collapse of the global economy; and hey look there’s another lady falling out of a window; she looks about equal to the poet hurled out of his country for words he wrote but which did not belong to him and whose death is about equal to the girl who was shot on the bus on her way to school this morning which is just about the same as the bearded man whose head was shoved into a sac while water was dumped over it and he died for an instant and came back to life and talked and talked and that’s about equal to the steroid illegally injected into the arm of a beautiful man who makes forty million dollars a year for injecting his arms with steroids so he can more skillfully wave a wooden stick at a ball, and in the ash we see the truest democracy there ever was: hey look it’s a little baby found in a dumpster how equal you are says the smiling lipstick to the civilized nation whose citizens walk the flooded streets looking for their homes, and in the ashes of the dead book the dead streets are equal to the eating disorders of movie stars which are equal to the dead soldiers who are equal to the homeruns which are equal to the bomb dropped by country ABC over weddings in the village of country XYZ which is equal to the earth swallowing up and devouring all of its foreigners which is just about equal to the decline in literacy in the most educated nation in the planet.
  14: 
  15: There is no end to this book.
  16: 
  17: There are no paragraph breaks to interrupt the smiling lipstick that goes on and on in one string of ashy words about how the declaration of peace is equal to the resumption of war and how the bodies that fall are equal to the birds that ascend and how the bomb in the Eiffel Tower is equal to the rising cost of natural gas, and the murmurs of the voices in the mud are equal to the murmurs of the expensive suits falling out of buildings and these are equal to the silence that kills with one breath and coddles life with another.

  77: 
  78: The nature of the mountain lands is captured here in the poetry of Henry Kendall and it is equally clear that this nature is not restricted to Australia, but extends to all the planetary mountain lands and the refuges they afford to those who would journey therein in search of peace, harmony and the chance to experience the natural world.

   3: When I heard at the close of the day how my name had been receiv’d with plaudits in the capitol, still it was not a happy night for me that follow’d,
   4: And else when I carous’d, or when my plans were accomplish’d, still I was not happy,
   5: But the day when I rose at dawn from the bed of perfect health, refresh’d, singing, inhaling the ripe breath of autumn,
   6: When I saw the full moon in the west grow pale and disappear in the morning light,
   7: When I wander’d alone over the beach, and undressing bathed, laughing with the cool waters, and saw the sun rise,
   8: And when I thought how my dear friend my lover was on his way coming, O then I was happy,
   9: O then each breath tasted sweeter, and all that day my food nourish’d me more, and the beautiful day pass’d well,
  10: And the next came with equal joy, and with the next at evening came my friend,
  11: And that night while all was still I heard the waters roll slowly continually up the shores,
  12: I heard the hissing rustle of the liquid and sands as directed to me whispering to congratulate me,
  13: For the one I love most lay sleeping by me under the same cover in the cool night,
  14: In the stillness in the autumn moonbeams his face was inclined toward me,
  15: And his arm lay lightly around my breast – and that night I was happy.

  20: Written 12 years after the conclusion of the War, Whitman's poem expresses the anguish felt by many when Virginia ("the noble sire") left the Union ("the Mother of All") and cast her lot with the Confederacy.
  21: 
  22: Virginia had always prided herself on being "the mother of states and statesman.
  23: 
  24: " Not only had she provided many of the most prominent political leaders and military men of the Revolutionary War era, but many of those who moved further west as the new nation expanded its borders could boast of roots in the Old Dominion as well.
  25: 
  26: Whitman's poem points out the folly of Virginia's rebelling against a government and a country that she herself had done so much to establish.
  27: 
  28: Those who came from Ohio, Indiana, and other Midwestern states to join the Union Army were, in a sense, returning to bear arms against the one who had sent them forth to begin with -- an irony that was not lost on Whitman.

   3: “You can’t kiss a movie,” Jean-Luc Godard said, and this is mostly true, in that you cannot initiate the kiss.
   4: 
   5: The Movie could initiate the kiss if The Movie wanted, as it is so much taller, leaning in, no way to demur, you would be too polite anyway, and, as the Roman poets have stressed, there is always something porous in the decorous.
   6: 
   7: So there can be kissing between you and The Movie, and it would be amazing, better the more incoherent The Movie is and the more you had to pay to see it, though in the movies it is said that prostitutes don’t like to kiss as kissing is too personal, though I disagree, as sometimes the human will make a show of locating you with a kiss, almost to prove to you that you are a real person with a face and that, absolutely, they know where the face is and the face isn’t, and this is how you know, for sure, that both of you have been paid.
   8: 
   9: But I don’t want to make you feel bad here, and I apologize, for you are entirely kissable, as I have watched you through windows and keyholes even though, up to this point, you do not appear in movies.
  10: 
  11: Often you appear holding a book in your hand and with God knows what playing in your head––I imagine you repeating to yourself, over and again, “the horse knows the way, the horse knows the way”––and remember: even someone as learned in film as Jean-Luc Godard got it a little wrong.
  12: 
  13: Youcankiss The Movie, if The Movie wants to kiss you.
  14: 
  15: It’s just that The Movie, finally, isn’t all that interested in your mouth.

   3: I came to encounter a coyoteI left all sorts of things behindYou couldn’t get on a plane unless you traveled lightBack then there were weight restrictions for planes, they don’t have them any longer, American bodies have no restrictions, they’ve become so big that there aren’t restrictions on the weight of bodies or luggage any more, but back then, I can’t even count how many times I picked up my bags and stepped on the scale, no matter how many times I weighed myself, I still wasn’t the least bit lighterNot knowing what else to do, I took out my booksThen I took out my clothesThen I went to the bathroom and defecatedThen I took out more clothesThen I threw upThen I took out more booksThen I stripped off all my clothes, held my bag, and stood on the scale, but I wasn’t the least bit lighterKnow what I mean?
   4: 
   5: That’s what it means to go on a tripThat’s what it means to leave the place where you liveTrips and then more tripsThere are things you need to carry with you to surviveNot knowing what else to do, I called my husband, filed for divorce, talked to my children and told them Mommy wouldn’t be home for a while, in other words, it was only after I abandoned my relationships, my attachments, and even my language that I was light enough to get on the plane, when I arrived, all I had was a few changes of clothes, some cash, my passport, my visa waiver, my credit cards, and an  international driver’s licenseIn California, the sky was blue, there was nothing but seashore, wild land, and housing developments, it was hazy and hard to see in the evenings, it was as if everything was immersed in mother’s milk, my toes got cold, I bought some socks, but after wearing them three days, the cheap things were ready to fall apart, I looked long and hard at them, feeling like a coyote(Yeah, I tell people I came aloneBut that is not entirely trueI was always thinking about the coyoteThe two of us traveling together)I saw dead raccoonsI saw dead skunksI smelled them tooSomeone I met the first day said to meThe whole place smells like skunk, must be a dead one somewhereIt was an unfamiliar scent, but now I know it wellThe whole place smells like skunk, must be a dead one somewhereI know to say that to people nowIn any case, I didn’t seeAny coyotes(Two traveling together)Someone in the streetTold me to get the hell out of hereWhy had I come?
   6: 
   7: I couldn’t find what I wanted, I had come so far but,get the hell out, this isn’t the place where the coyotes are, they’re farther away, in deeper places, where there is nothing, where there is much more emptinessSo I headed eastFrom the western edge of the continent to the eastThe interstatesWith odd numbers run north and southWhile even numbers run east and westThose in the 500s are the bypasses for I-5 (north-south)Those in the 800s are the bypasses for I-8 (east-west)I took I-5 south to I-580I went further south to I-8 then went eastEast, east, eastAnd even further eastIn Arizona, I took I-17At Flagstaff, I took US Route 89I dashed into a roadside motel, slept, and wokeAnd started driving againThe morning light shone brilliantlyEach time I stopped to fill up with gas, I bought some brownies, each individually wrapped, I tore off the wrappers with one hand and ate them as I drove, the ridiculously sweet lumps stuck to the roof  of my mouth, when I stopped in front of a motel that night, my fingers didn’t want to leave the steering wheel, at the registration desk, the words I needed to say in English didn’t rise to my lips, even though  I knew them all too well(Two traveling together)There was a woman standing at the side of the road, I called out to her in broken English, asking her what was the matter, she answered in what was also broken EnglishWould you mind taking me to the nearest gas station?

  10: 
  11: From California, I answeredNo, that’s not what I meantWhat tribe are you from?
  12: 
  13: she asked(Two traveling together)From Kayenta I took US Route 163 toward Monument ValleyI had heard that coyotes lived there long agoThat it’s an amazing place, the moon rises, the sun setsI imagined it would be like seeing the oceanBut when I got there, it wasn’t like the ocean at allRocks soared into the airRocks, rocks, even more rocksRed rocksIn the dustI watched the sun set over themBy the time I got back to Route 163, the sun had sunk deep beyond the horizon, the only thing I could see was the road in front of me,  I drove on looking for a place to sleep, but I didn’t see a thing, there wasn’t anything to see, air rushed through my cracked window,  letting out a long, thin, high-pitched whistleHii-iuu-uuuuuHii-iuu-uuuuuLike a reed fluteMy thin, hard window was slightly open, the wind rushed in but couldn’t escapeHii-iuuuUuu-uuuuuUuu-hiiuuuuu(Two of us heard it)I drove a long way before spying a large motel, I saw the vacancy sign as I approached, I thought I’d have to drive for hours and hours before finding a place to sleep, I thought I wouldn’t stop, that I’d drive all night without stopping, but the place I found was part of a chain you see in every city, the bed was big and deep, and there was lots of hot water in the tub(Two of us were there)The next morningThe car was completely filthyThe whole thing was covered with bright red dirt and sandThe windshield was covered with the splattered bodies of countless insectsNo one knew I had slept there, nor that I was leaving, nor which direction I was headed, no one knewIt was a day that invitedDeath along the roadsideI hadn’t even driven for five minutes before I saw it —A single, dead coyoteLying on its back, legs in the air(It was both me andMy travel companion, too)

 145: WILL you allow me space in your columns to refer to a social question of some importance, and that is with regard to the utterly reckless way in which young men are drafted off from England to Australia! Not a steamer reaches us in the colonies without bringing scores of these unfortunates, who are simply run out of their homes by their parents.
 146: 
 147: The situations they occupy in the colonies are potato-peelers at inferior hotels, washers-up at sixpenny restaurants, billiard markers and similar menial and degrading positions.
 148: 
 149: Let anyone take a turn along the Yarra and the wharves in Melbourne, or through the domain in Sydney, and he will find new chums by the score.

 151: In all the cities and bush towns of the colonies they are the outcasts of our civilisation, without money and without a trade.
 152: 
 153: We are told that these young men come here to seek their fortunes, but from what they say, it is evident that, in reality, their parents and relatives pay their passage to Australia in the hope of never seeing them again.
 154: 
 155: Let me say in conclusion that to send to Australia a poor young man without a good trade is to confuse him to hopeless drudgery in the centres of civilisation, or to oblivion and death in the vast silent wastes where even the blacks sometimes die for want of water.

  24: Overall Explanation
  25: It is reasonable to assume that this poem was written during a time of sickness for Donne, because it explores the idea of Donne's death with some anguish.
  26: 
  27: Donne looks into his soul and finds it full of evil ("black").
  28:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  29: He compares it first to someone who has committed a terrible wrong in some country and doesn't dare return.
  30: 
  31: In this comparison, the country which has suffered this horrible wrong represents God.
  32: 
  33: In his second comparison, his soul is a thief, who wants to get out of prison until he is sentenced to death, at which time life in prison looks quite appealing!
  34: Donne builds up the intensity of the poem with circular reasoning - he needs the grace to repent, but will not have grace until he repents.
  35: 
  36: The ending is a poweful one, partially because Donne employs the paradox of red blood dying something white to create a strong image in the mind.
  37: 
  38: What he means here of course is that the reality of Christ dying for to save humans' souls - the tangible red blood, is enough to make us pure in the eyes of God (white souls).

   3: INTO the gulf and the pit of the dark night, the cold night, there is a man goes into the dark and the cold and when he comes back to his people he brings fire in his hands and they remember him in the years afterward as the fire bringer-they remember or forget-the man whose head kept singing to the want of his home, the want of his people.
   4: 
   5: For this man there is no name thought of-he has broken from jungles and the old oxen and the old wagons-circled the earth with ships-belted the earth with steel-swung with wings and a drumming motor in the high blue sky-shot his words on a wireless way through shattering sea storms:-out from the night and out from the jungles his head keeps singing-there is no road for him but on and on.
   6: 
   7: Against the sea bastions and the land bastions, against the great air pockets of stars and atoms, he points a finger, finds a release clutch, touches a button no man knew before.
   8: 
   9: The soldier with a smoking gun and a gas mask-the workshop man under the smokestacks and the blueprints-these two are brothers of the handshake never forgotten-for these two we give the salt tears of our eyes, the salute of red roses, the flame-won scarlet of poppies.
  10: 
  11: For the soldier who gives all, for the workshop man who gives all, for these the red bar is on the flag-the red bar is the heart's-blood of the mother who gave him, the land that gave him.
  12: 
  13: The gray foam and the great wheels of war go by and take all-and the years give mist and ashes-and our feet stand at these, the memory places of the known and the unknown, and our hands give a flame-won poppy-our hands touch the red bar of a flag for the sake of those who gave-and gave all.

   9: One was three spotted waterbirds, zigzagging, cutting scrolls and jags, writing a bird Sanscrit of wing points, half over the sand, half over the water, a half-love for the sea, a half-love for the land.
  10: 
  11: I took away three thoughts.
  12: 
  13: One was a thing my people call "love," a shut-in river hunting the sea, breaking white falls between tall clefs of hill country.
  14: 
  15: One was a thing my people call "silence," the wind running over the butter faced sand-flowers, running over the sea, and never heard of again.
  16: 
  17: One was a thing my people call "death," neither a whistle in the little sandhills, nor a bird Sanscrit of wing points, yet a coat all the stars and seas have worn, yet a face the beach wears between sunset and dusk.

   5: From such a rag that has wiped the secret sores of kings and overlords across the milleniums of human marches and babblings,

  69: 
  70: This experience of intimate aloofness reached its climax when, having missed the train at a wayside station — a chance which meant my being late in my return to Camp — we lay down in a field by the track and, waiting for the train, read ballads to one another.
  71: 
  72: The sudden rediscovery of the verse quoted — a sixteenth century anonymous lyric — so intense, personal, and modern in its vivid cry, among the long objective ballads, startled us both back to the world of pains and desires, where we two must leave one another, and the return to School and I to Camp and the Army.

   5: for I want pennies to buy some meat!” When she left home she had slippers on; But, alas! poor child, now they were gone.
   6: 
   7: For she lost both of them while hurrying across the street, Out of the way of two carriages which were near by her feet.
   8: 
   9: So the little girl went on, while the snow fell thick and fast; And the child’s heart felt cold and downcast, For nobody had bought any matches that day, Which filled her little mind with grief and dismay.
  10: 
  11: Alas! she was hungry and shivering with cold; So in a corner between two houses she made bold To take shelter from the violent storm.
  12: 
  13: Poor little waif! wishing to herself she’d never been born.
  14: 
  15: And she grew colder and colder, and feared to go home For fear of her father beating her; and she felt woe-begone Because she could carry home no pennies to buy bread, And to go home without pennies she was in dread.
  16: 
  17: The large flakes of snow covered her ringlets of fair hair; While the passers-by for her had no care, As they hurried along to their homes at a quick pace, While the cold wind blew in the match girl’s face.
  18: 
  19: As night wore on her hands were numb with cold, And no longer her strength could her uphold, When an idea into her little head came: She’d strike a match and warm her hands at the flame.
  20: 
  21: And she lighted the match, and it burned brightly, And it helped to fill her heart with glee; And she thought she was sitting at a stove very grand; But, alas! she was found dead, with a match in her hand! Her body was found half-covered with snow, And as the people gazed thereon their hearts were full of woe; And many present let fall a burning tear Because she was found dead on the last night of the year, In that mighty city of London, wherein is plenty of gold— But, alas! their charity towards street waifs is rather cold.
  22: 
  23: But I hope the match girl’s in Heaven, beside her Saviour dear, A bright reward for all the hardships she suffered here.

   3: As I stood upon London Bridge and viewed the mighty throng Of thousands of people in cabs and ’busses rapidly whirling along, All furiously driving to and fro, Up one street and down another as quick as they could go: Then I was struck with the discordant sound of human voices there, Which seemed to me like wild geese cackling in the air: And the river Thames is a most beautiful sight, To see the steamers sailing upon it by day and by night.
   4: 
   5: And the Tower of London is most gloomy to behold, And the crown of England lies there, begemmed with precious stones and gold; King Henry the Sixth was murdered there by the Duke of Glo’ster, And when he killed him with his sword he called him an impostor.

  12: 
  13: Then there’s two beautiful water-fountains spouting up very high, Where the weary traveller can drink when he feels dry; And at the foot of the monument there’s three bronze lions in grand array, Enough to make the stranger’s heart throb with dismay.
  14: 
  15: Then there’s Mr Spurgeon, a great preacher, which no one dare gainsay, I went to hear him preach on the Sabbath-day, And he made my heart feel light and gay, When I heard him preach and pray.
  16: 
  17: And the Tabernacle was crowded from ceiling to floor, And many were standing outside the door; He is an eloquent preacher I honestly declare, And I was struck with admiration as on him I did stare.
  18: 
  19: Then there’s Petticoat Lane I venture to say, It’s a wonderful place on the Sabbath-day; There wearing-apparel can be bought to suit the young or old, For the ready cash, silver, coppers, or gold.
  20: 
  21: Oh! mighty city of London! you are wonderful to see, And thy beauties no doubt fill the tourist’s heart with glee; But during my short stay, and while wandering there, Mr Spurgeon was the only man I heard speaking proper English I do declare.

   3: On the Gilfillan burial day, In the Hill o’ Balgay, It was a most solemn sight to see, Not fewer than thirty thousand people assembled in Dundee, All watching the funeral procession of Gilfillan that day, That death had suddenly taken away, And was going to be buried in the Hill o’ Balgay.
   4: 
   5: There were about three thousand people in the procession alone, And many were shedding tears, and several did moan, And their bosoms heaved with pain, Because they knew they would never look upon his like again.
   6: 
   7: There could not be fewer than fifty carriages in the procession that day, And gentlemen in some of them that had come from far away, And in whispers some of them did say, As the hearse bore the precious corpse away, Along the Nethergate that day.
   8: 
   9: I’m sure he will be greatly missed by the poor, For he never turned them empty-handed away from his door; And to assist them in distress it didn’t give him pain, And I’m sure the poor will never look upon his like again.
  10: 
  11: On the Gilfillan burial day, in the Hill o’ Balgay, There was a body of policemen marshalled in grand array, And marched in front of the procession all the way; Also the relatives and friends of the deceas’d, Whom I hope from all sorrows has been releas’d, And whose soul I hope to heaven has fled away, To sing with saints above for ever and aye.
  12: 
  13: The Provost, Magistrates, and Town Council were in the procession that day; Also Mrs Gilfillan, who cried and sobbed all the way For her kind husband, that was always affable and gay, Which she will remember until her dying day.
  14: 
  15: When the procession arrived in the Hill o’ Balgay, The people were almost as hush as death, and many of them did say— As long as we live we’ll remember the day That the great Gilfillan was buried in the Hill o’Balgay.
  16: 
  17: When the body of the great Gilfillan was lowered into the grave, ’Twas then the people’s hearts with sorrow did heave; And with tearful eyes and bated breath, Mrs Gilfillan lamented her loving husband’s death.
  18: 
  19: Then she dropped a ringlet of immortelles into his grave, Then took one last fond look, and in sorrow did leave; And all the people left with sad hearts that day, And that ended the Gilfillan burial in the Hill o’ Balgay.

  11: He has written the life of Sir Walter Scott, And while he lives he will never be forgot, Nor when he is dead, Because by his admirers it will be often read; And fill their minds with wonder and delight, And wile away the tedious hours on a cold winter’s night.
  12: 
  13: He has also written about the Bards of the Bible, Which occupied nearly three years in which he was not idle, Because when he sits down to write he does it with might and main, And to get an interview with him it would be almost vain, And in that he is always right, For the Bible tells us whatever your hands findeth to do, Do it with all your might.

  16:

 230: COMMENT
 231: As a fable about a young American woman's struggle with the conflicting demands of being a subject and being an aesthetic object, "Alice Ray" is fascinating from several angles.
 232: 

[PROSE TO REMOVE - Will be deleted]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 233: One approach would be to see it as a fable about fashion; as editor of Godey's Ladies' Book, Hale was an arbiter of women's fashions, yet in "Alice Ray" she condemns the fashionable world.
 234: 
 235: As in "The Three Hours," Hale engages with the problem of the relation between an ideal republican female subjectivity and the traditions of aristocracy (here, in the form of bodily spectacle).
 236: 
 237: Alice Ray's struggle with beauty relates broadly to eighteenth-century aesthetic theory (e.
 238: 
 239: g.
 240: 
 241: Burke, Kant), in which "the beautiful" was associated with women's objecthood and social connection (as opposed to "the sublime," male subjectivity, individualism).
 242: 
 243: "Alice Ray" thus offers a critique of terms of aesthetic value.
 244: 
 245: Perhaps most baffling in this fable is the "Bloody Spring" (a supernaturalized figure of cosmetics?
 246: 
 247: ), its witching flora and fauna, and its origin in the murder of a beautiful white woman by Indians.
 248:

  27: "Besides that in sundry respects I must acknowledge me to profit by you whenever we meet, you are often to me, and were yesterday especially, as a good watch-man to admonish that the hours of the night pass on (for so I call my life as yet obscure and unserviceable to mankind) and that the day is at hand, wherein Christ commands all to labor while there is light: which because I am persuaded you do to no other purpose, than out of a true desire that God should be honor'd in every one, I am ever ready, you know, when occasion is, to give you account, as I ought, though unask'd, of my tardy moving according to the precept of my conscience, which I firmly trust is not without God.
  28: 
  29: Yet now I will not strain for any set apology, but only refer myself to what my mind shall have at any time to declare herself at her best ease.

  31: Yet if you think, as you said, that too much love of learning is in fault, and that I have given up myself to dream away my years in the arms of studious retirement, like Endymion with the moon on Latmus hill; yet consider, that if it were no more but this, to overcome this, there is on the other side both ill more bewitchful to entice away, and natural years more available to withdraw to that which you wish me; as first all the fond hopes which forward youth and vanity are fledge with, none of which can sort with this Pluto's helmet, as Homer calls it, of obscurity, and would soon cause me to throw it off, if there were nothing else in't but an affected and fruitless curiosity of knowing; and then a natural desire of honor and renown, which I think possesses the breast of every scholar, as well of him that shall, as of him that never shall obtain it (if this be altogether bad) which would quickly oversway this flegm and melancholy of bashfulness, or that other humor, and prevail with me to prefer a life, that had at least some credit in it, some place given it, before a manner of living much disregarded and discountenanc'd.
  32: 
  33: There is besides this, as all well know, about this time of a man's life, a strong inclination, be it good or no, to build up a house and family of his own in the best manner he may; to which nothing is more helpful than the early entring into some credible employment, and nothing more cross than my way, which my wasting youth would presently bethink her of, and kill one love with another, if that were all.
  34: 
  35: But what delight or what peculiar conceit, may you in charity think, could hold out against the long knowledge of a contrary command from above, and the terrible seisure of him that hid his talent?
  36: 
  37: Therefore commit grace to grace, or nature to nature, there will be found on the other way more obvious temptations to bad, as gain, preferment, ambition, more winning presentments of good, and more prone affections of nature to incline and dispose, not counting outward causes, as expectations and murmurs of friends, scandals taken, and such like, than the bare love of notions could resist.
  38: 
  39: So that if it be that which you suppose, it had by this been round about begirt and overmaster'd, whether it had proceeded from virtue, vice, or nature in me.
  40: 
  41: Yet that you may see that I am some time suspicious of myself, and do take notice of a certain belatedness in me, I am the bolder to send you some of my nightward thoughts some while since, since they come in fitly, in a Petrarchian staza.

 514: 
 515: The feelings which constitute poetry are the same in all ages, they are acted upon by similar causes.

  35: The natives in this part of India perform the operation of crossing their rivers by means of the jhoola, or rope-bridge; holding on with the hands and feet, and making a loop of their bodies: but, for those unaccustomed to their exercises, there is a wooden slide attached to the rope.

  61: The vicinity of Sbeitlah is still the Leonum arida natrix, and lion-hunting forms not only one of the chief amusements, but even most profitable occupations: so replete is every spot of ground, every shattered column, nay, every lion slain, with classical feeling and allusion, that this was nature's nursery whence one hundred lions at a time were furnished, for the sports of warlike Rome, at the command of Sylla: Pompey drew hence six hundred, and Caesar was content with four hundred of the fiercest.

   4: 
   5: Our enemies have fall'n, have fall'n: they came; The leaves were wet with women's tears: they heard A noise of songs they would not understand: They mark'd it with the red cross to the fall, And would have strown it, and are fall'n themselves.
   6: 
   7: Our enemies have fall'n, have fall'n: they came, The woodmen with their axes: lo the tree! But we will make it faggots for the hearth, And shape it plank and beam for roof and floor, And boats and bridges for the use of men.
   8: 
   9: Our enemies have fall'n, have fall'n: they struck; With their own blows they hurt themselves, nor knew There dwelt an iron nature in the grain: The glittering axe was broken in their arms, Their arms were shatter'd to the shoulder blade.
  10: 
  11: Our enemies have fall'n, but this shall grow A night of Summer from the heat, a breadth Of Autumn, dropping fruits of power; and roll'd With music in the growing breeze of Time, The tops shall strike from star to star, the fangs Shall move the stony bases of the world.

  71: VII But, propt on beds of amaranth and moly, How sweet (while warm airs lull us, blowing lowly) With half-dropt eyelid still, Beneath a heaven dark and holy, To watch the long bright river drawing slowly His waters from the purple hill— To hear the dewy echoes calling From cave to cave thro' the thick-twined vine— To watch the emerald-colour'd water falling Thro' many a wov'n acanthus-wreath divine! Only to hear and see the far-off sparkling brine, Only to hear were sweet, stretch'd out beneath the pine.

  80: 
  81: But they smile, they find a music centred in a doleful song Steaming up, a lamentation and an ancient tale of wrong, Like a tale of little meaning tho' the words are strong; Chanted from an ill-used race of men that cleave the soil, Sow the seed, and reap the harvest with enduring toil, Storing yearly little dues of wheat, and wine and oil; Till they perish and they suffer—some, 'tis whisper'd—down in hell Suffer endless anguish, others in Elysian valleys dwell, Resting weary limbs at last on beds of asphodel.

  34: 
  35: Would the happy spirit descend From the realms of light and song, In the chamber or the street, As she looks among the blest, Should I fear to greet my friend Or to say "Forgive the wrong," Or to ask her, "Take me, sweet, To the regions of thy rest"?
  36: 
  37: But the broad light glares and beats, And the shadow flits and fleets And will not let me be; And I loathe the squares and streets, And the faces that one meets, Hearts with no love for me: Always I long to creep Into some still cavern deep, There to weep, and weep, and weep My whole soul out to thee.

  55: 'After leaving Ayr Keats and Brown appear to have been detained by rain at some place twelve miles along the road, when Keats took the opportunity of going on with his letter to Reynolds begun at Maybole.

  57: They were enroute for Glasgow (casually mentioned in a letter to Bailey begun at Inverary on the 18th of July), which they took on their way from Ayr to Loch Lomond and Inverary.
  58: 
  59: The poem given above is mentioned to Bailey as having been written within a few days of the sonnet in Burns's cottage, so that, although it is headed as above in the manuscript written at the end of Sir Charles Dilke's copy of Endymion, it seems more probable that the term Highlands was used in a lax popular sense than that the poem was composed after the visit to Staffa.
  60: 
  61: Indeed in the letter to Bailey he speaks of the whole tour as in the Highlands.
  62: 
  63: Keats expected to be by Loch Lomond about the 15th of July, and may have written this poem on high ground anywhere about the Loch, with the scenery of which he was very much impressed.

  19: 'This sonnet appears to have been written on the 22nd of January 1818, in the folio Shakespeare containing the manuscript of the preceding poem; but I think Keats must have drafted it before writing it in the Shakespeare; and there is a second manuscript in Sir Charles Dilke's copy of Endymion.

 765: Taken in itself apart from the poem, it might be held to be an inopportune description; but in the context of this most tragic and pathetic story, it has to me a surpassing fitness -- a fitness astonishing in the work of a youth of Keats's age in 1818.
 766: 
 767: The idea of maternity thus connected as it were by chance with the image of this widowed girl on the borders of insanity emphasizes in the most beautiful way the helpless misery of a life wrecked by the wickedness of others, and throws into ghastly contrast the joy of what should have been and the agony of what was.

 769: (stanza XLVIII): Hunt observes here - "It is curious to see how the simple pathos of Boccaccio, or (which is the same thing) the simple intensity of the heroine's feelings, suffices our author more and more, as he gets to the end of his story.
 770: 
 771: And he has related it as happily, as if he had never written any poetry but that of the heart.
 772: 
 773: (stanza LIV): Whether the "savage and tartarly" assailants of Keats's day availed themselves of the word "leafits" in the 8th line for an accusation of word-coining, I do not know; but as far as I have been able to ascertain this diminutive of "leaf" is peculiar to the present passage.
 774: 
 775: (stanza LXII): Hunt says - "The passage about the tone of her voice, -- the poor lost-witted coaxing, -- the 'chuckle,' in which she asks after her Pilgrim and her Basil,-- is as true and touching an instance of the effect of a happy familiar word, as any in all poetry.
 776: 
 777: " It is difficult to imagine that these sentences of Hunt's were not somehow misprinted; but, as the review occurs only in the original issue of The Indicator, one has no means of testing this passage by comparison with later editions.
 778: 
 779: It can hardly be supposed that Hunt really thought the Pilgrim meant Lorenzo; and it ought not to be necessary to explain that the poor lost girl called after any pilgrim whom chance sent her way, enquiring of him where her Basil was.

  34: 
  35: It seems fair to assume that the reason of its being so high up on the page is that it thus faces a space of equal size containing no words except a boldly printed heading of Shakespeare's poem, A Lover's Complaint, as if in that mournful moment Keats desired to appropriate to his last poetic utterance a style and title already immortal.

  25: The sonnet is said to have been "an extempore effusion, and without the alteration of a single word;" but as Clarke seems to have been asleep when it was written we are justified in construing the word 'extempore' with a certain latitude.
  26: 
  27: It was certainly most unusual for Keats to write that much without a single erasure, and it is quite possible that he jotted the sonnet down in pencil in a note-book which he certainly carried at that time and certainly did draft sonnets in.
  28: 
  29: In any case he probably had ample time and quiet, while Clarke was sleeping, to elaborate the two highly finished quatrains in his mind: the third quatrain and the couplet are of inferior merit, and might well be extemporary.

  26: 
  27: Indeed the second quatrain seems to me to be too well felt for so vague an attitude as Keats's must have been towards Homer before he knew any version at all; but the late Dante Gabriel Rossetti, whose intuitions in such matters were of the keenest, and entitled to the most careful consideration, held that the present sonnet must have preceded that of 1816, and received with considerable reserve the evidence as to the date which I communicated to him in the course of our correspondence.

  11: BOOK I A thing of beauty is a joy for ever: Its loveliness increases; it will never Pass into nothingness; but still will keep A bower quiet for us, and a sleep Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.
  12: 
  13: Therefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing A flowery band to bind us to the earth, Spite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth Of noble natures, of the gloomy days, Of all the unhealthy and o'er-darkened ways Made for our searching: yes, in spite of all, Some shape of beauty moves away the pall From our dark spirits.
  14: 
  15: Such the sun, the moon, Trees old and young, sprouting a shady boon For simple sheep; and such are daffodils With the green world they live in; and clear rills That for themselves a cooling covert make 'Gainst the hot season; the mid forest brake, Rich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms: And such too is the grandeur of the dooms We have imagined for the mighty dead; All lovely tales that we have heard or read: An endless fountain of immortal drink, Pouring unto us from the heaven's brink.
  16: 
  17: Nor do we merely feel these essences For one short hour; no, even as the trees That whisper round a temple become soon Dear as the temple's self, so does the moon, The passion poesy, glories infinite, Haunt us till they become a cheering light Unto our souls, and bound to us so fast, That, whether there be shine, or gloom o'ercast; They always must be with us, or we die.
  18: 
  19: Therefore, 'tis with full happiness that I Will trace the story of Endymion.
  20: 
  21: The very music of the name has gone Into my being, and each pleasant scene Is growing fresh before me as the green Of our own valleys: so I will begin Now while I cannot hear the city's din; Now while the early budders are just new, And run in mazes of the youngest hue About old forests; while the willow trails Its delicate amber; and the dairy pails Bring home increase of milk.
  22: 
  23: And, as the year Grows lush in juicy stalks, I'll smoothly steer My little boat, for many quiet hours, With streams that deepen freshly into bowers.
  24: 
  25: Many and many a verse I hope to write, Before the daisies, vermeil rimm'd and white, Hide in deep herbage; and ere yet the bees Hum about globes of clover and sweet peas, I must be near the middle of my story.
  26: 
  27: O may no wintry season, bare and hoary, See it half finish'd: but let Autumn bold, With universal tinge of sober gold, Be all about me when I make an end.
  28: 
  29: And now, at once adventuresome, I send My herald thought into a wilderness: There let its trumpet blow, and quickly dress My uncertain path with green, that I may speed Easily onward, thorough flowers and weed.

  29: 
  30: The whole distance from the place whence we started to our landing on the other side, including the length we were carried by the current, was computed by those on board the frigate at upwards of four English miles; though the actual breadth is barely one.
  31: 
  32: The rapidity of the current is such that no boat can row directly across, and it may in some measure be estimated from the circumstance of the whole distance being accomplished by one of the parties in an hour and five, and by the other in an hour and ten, minutes.

  34: The water was extremely cold from the melting of the moutain-snows.
  35: 
  36: About three weeks before, in April, we had made an attempt, but having ridden all the way from the Troad the same morning, and the water being an icy chillness, we found it necessary to postpone the completion till the frigate anchored below the castles, when we swam the straits, as just stated; entering a considerable way above the European, and landing below the Asiatic, fort.
  37: 
  38: Chevalier says that a young Jew swam the same distance for his mistress; and Oliver mentions its having been done by a Neapolitan; but our consul, Tarragona, remembered neither of these circumstances, and tried to dissuade us from the attempt.
  39: 
  40: A number of the Salsette's crew were known to have accomplished a greater distance; and the only thing that surprised me was, that, as doubts had been entertained of the truth of Leander's story, no traveller had ever endeavoured to ascertain its practicability.

   8: My own teeth are those grates that grilled the martyrs, & my little lamb’s ears quiver each afternoon when the wind coughs in fits and pale skies smoke with incense from a clandestine Mass, perhaps on a runaway shallop with sails sewn from stolen cassocks, perhaps on a newborn isle with a thatched church, novices crawling like iguanas around stations of the cross.

   3: Germ of new life, whose powers expanding slow For many a moon their full perfection wait,— Haste, precious pledge of happy love, to go Auspicious borne through life's mysterious gate.
   4: 
   5: What powers lie folded in thy curious frame,— Senses from objects locked, and mind from thought! How little canst thou guess thy lofty claim To grasp at all the worlds the Almighty wrought! And see, the genial season's warmth to share, Fresh younglings shoot, and opening roses glow! Swarms of new life exulting fill the air,— Haste, infant bud of being, haste to blow! For thee the nurse prepares her lulling songs, The eager matrons count the lingering day; But far the most thy anxious parent longs On thy soft cheek a mother's kiss to lay.
   6: 
   7: She only asks to lay her burden down, That her glad arms that burden may resume; And nature's sharpest pangs her wishes crown, That free thee living from thy living tomb.

  12: 
  13: Haste, little captive, burst thy prison doors! Launch on the living world, and spring to light! Nature for thee displays her various stores, Opens her thousand inlets of delight.
  14: 
  15: If charmed verse or muttered prayers had power, With favouring spells to speed thee on thy way, Anxious I'd bid my beads each passing hour, Till thy wished smile thy mother's pangs o'erpay.

  70: 
  71: Now these and such-like influences of tender specialty must not—so fine they be— fall in neglect and all their loveliness be lost, being to the soul deep springs of happiness, and full of lovingkindness to the natural man, who is apt kindly to judge of good by comfortable effect.
  72: 
  73: Thus all men ever hav judged the wholesomness of food from the comfort of body ensuing thereupon, whereby all animals retrieve their proper diet; but if when in discomfort ’tis for pleasant hope of health restored we swallow nauseous medicines, so mystics use asceticism, yea, and no man readier than they to assert eventual happiness to justify their conduct.
  74: 
  75: Whence it is not strange (for so scientific minds in search of truth digest assimilable hypotheses) they should extend their pragmatism, and from their happiness deduce the very existence and the natur of God, and take religious consolation for the ground of faith: as if the pleasur of life wer the sign-manual of Nature when she set her hand to her covenant.
  76: 
  77: But man, vain of his Reason and thinking more to assure its independence, wil disclaim complicity with human emotion; and regarding his Mother deemeth it dutiful and nobler in honesty coldly to criticize than purblindly to love; and in pride of this quarrel he hath been led in the end to make distinction of kind 'twixt Pleasur and Happiness; observing truly enough how one may hav pleasure and yet miss happiness; but this warpeth the sense and common use of speech, since all tongues in the world call children and silly folk happy and sometimes ev’n brutes.
  78: 
  79: The name of happiness is but a wider term for the unalloy’d conditions of the Pleasur of Life, attendant on all function, and not to be deny’d to th’ soul, unless forsooth in our thought of nature spiritual is by definition unnatural.

  27: In his collection of essays "Of Poetry and Poets," Eberhart said that he wrote "The Fury of Aerial Bombardment" in 1944 while, as a Navy officer, teaching aerial free gunnery; that too often names of his students turned up on the death lists; and that this depressed him so much that, feeling acutely the ruthlessness and senselessness of war, he wrote the first three stanzas of the poem.
  28: 
  29: It was probably a week or two later that, feeling something should be added, something quite removed from the passion of the first three stanzas, he composed the final stanza.
  30: 
  31: This, he wrote, it is said, in relation to the others made the poem particularly modern and, if he had not added it, he would probably never have published the poem.

   5: In “phabetical” he uses a toy microscope with a built-in video camera to capture highly magnified images of text, often with his hand moving the microscope across the page to capture still text in motion.
   6: 
   7: As he has done here, Vassilakis sometimes modifies the settings on the camera so that the texts are captured in unnatural colors, and he sometimes reverses the polarity of these to further alter their materiality.
   8: 
   9: In this poem, he has used a software process to band many slips of texts into columns and rows, and he has captured these blocks of text in motion so that we can see all of the middle column but only half of the two columns to either side of it.
  10: 
  11: The result uses Greek letters (an homage to his ancestry) so abstracted that they appear before us almost as concrete images: birds, an arm reaching out, a child kicking a ball.

   3: As I stood upon London Bridge and viewed the mighty throng Of thousands of people in cabs and ’busses rapidly whirling along, All furiously driving to and fro, Up one street and down another as quick as they could go: Then I was struck with the discordant sound of human voices there, Which seemed to me like wild geese cackling in the air: And the river Thames is a most beautiful sight, To see the steamers sailing upon it by day and by night.
   4: 
   5: And the Tower of London is most gloomy to behold, And the crown of England lies there, begemmed with precious stones and gold; King Henry the Sixth was murdered there by the Duke of Glo’ster, And when he killed him with his sword he called him an impostor.
   6: 
   7: St.
   8: 
   9: Paul’s Cathedral is the finest building that ever I did see, There’s no building can surpass it in the city of Dundee, Because it’s magnificent to behold, With its beautiful dome and spire glottering like gold.
  10: 
  11: And as for Nelson’s Monument that stands in Trafalgar Square, It is a most stately monument I most solemnly declare, And towering defiantly very high, Which arrests strangers’ attention while passing by.
  12: 
  13: Then there’s two beautiful water-fountains spouting up very high, Where the weary traveller can drink when he feels dry; And at the foot of the monument there’s three bronze lions in grand array, Enough to make the stranger’s heart throb with dismay.
  14: 
  15: Then there’s Mr Spurgeon, a great preacher, which no one dare gainsay, I went to hear him preach on the Sabbath-day, And he made my heart feel light and gay, When I heard him preach and pray.
  16: 
  17: And the Tabernacle was crowded from ceiling to floor, And many were standing outside the door; He is an eloquent preacher I honestly declare, And I was struck with admiration as on him I did stare.
  18: 
  19: Then there’s Petticoat Lane I venture to say, It’s a wonderful place on the Sabbath-day; There wearing-apparel can be bought to suit the young or old, For the ready cash, silver, coppers, or gold.
  20: 
  21: Oh! mighty city of London! you are wonderful to see, And thy beauties no doubt fill the tourist’s heart with glee; But during my short stay, and while wandering there, Mr Spurgeon was the only man I heard speaking proper English I do declare.

   7: He is a man of genius bright, And in him his congregation does delight, Because they find him to be honest and plain, Affable in temper, and seldom known to complain.

   9: He preaches in a plain straightforward way, The people flock to hear him night and day, And hundreds from the doors are often turn’d away, Because he is the greatest preacher of the present day.
  10: 
  11: He has written the life of Sir Walter Scott, And while he lives he will never be forgot, Nor when he is dead, Because by his admirers it will be often read; And fill their minds with wonder and delight, And wile away the tedious hours on a cold winter’s night.
  12: 
  13: He has also written about the Bards of the Bible, Which occupied nearly three years in which he was not idle, Because when he sits down to write he does it with might and main, And to get an interview with him it would be almost vain, And in that he is always right, For the Bible tells us whatever your hands findeth to do, Do it with all your might.
  14: 
  15: Rev.
  16: 
  17: George Gilfillan of Dundee, I must conclude my muse, And to write in praise of thee my pen does not refuse, Nor does it give me pain to tell the world fearlessly, that when You are dead they shall not look upon your like again.

   3: On the Gilfillan burial day, In the Hill o’ Balgay, It was a most solemn sight to see, Not fewer than thirty thousand people assembled in Dundee, All watching the funeral procession of Gilfillan that day, That death had suddenly taken away, And was going to be buried in the Hill o’ Balgay.
   4: 
   5: There were about three thousand people in the procession alone, And many were shedding tears, and several did moan, And their bosoms heaved with pain, Because they knew they would never look upon his like again.
   6: 
   7: There could not be fewer than fifty carriages in the procession that day, And gentlemen in some of them that had come from far away, And in whispers some of them did say, As the hearse bore the precious corpse away, Along the Nethergate that day.
   8: 
   9: I’m sure he will be greatly missed by the poor, For he never turned them empty-handed away from his door; And to assist them in distress it didn’t give him pain, And I’m sure the poor will never look upon his like again.
  10: 
  11: On the Gilfillan burial day, in the Hill o’ Balgay, There was a body of policemen marshalled in grand array, And marched in front of the procession all the way; Also the relatives and friends of the deceas’d, Whom I hope from all sorrows has been releas’d, And whose soul I hope to heaven has fled away, To sing with saints above for ever and aye.
  12: 
  13: The Provost, Magistrates, and Town Council were in the procession that day; Also Mrs Gilfillan, who cried and sobbed all the way For her kind husband, that was always affable and gay, Which she will remember until her dying day.
  14: 
  15: When the procession arrived in the Hill o’ Balgay, The people were almost as hush as death, and many of them did say— As long as we live we’ll remember the day That the great Gilfillan was buried in the Hill o’Balgay.
  16: 
  17: When the body of the great Gilfillan was lowered into the grave, ’Twas then the people’s hearts with sorrow did heave; And with tearful eyes and bated breath, Mrs Gilfillan lamented her loving husband’s death.
  18: 
  19: Then she dropped a ringlet of immortelles into his grave, Then took one last fond look, and in sorrow did leave; And all the people left with sad hearts that day, And that ended the Gilfillan burial in the Hill o’ Balgay.

   5: for I want pennies to buy some meat!” When she left home she had slippers on; But, alas! poor child, now they were gone.
   6: 
   7: For she lost both of them while hurrying across the street, Out of the way of two carriages which were near by her feet.
   8: 
   9: So the little girl went on, while the snow fell thick and fast; And the child’s heart felt cold and downcast, For nobody had bought any matches that day, Which filled her little mind with grief and dismay.
  10: 
  11: Alas! she was hungry and shivering with cold; So in a corner between two houses she made bold To take shelter from the violent storm.
  12: 
  13: Poor little waif! wishing to herself she’d never been born.
  14: 
  15: And she grew colder and colder, and feared to go home For fear of her father beating her; and she felt woe-begone Because she could carry home no pennies to buy bread, And to go home without pennies she was in dread.
  16: 
  17: The large flakes of snow covered her ringlets of fair hair; While the passers-by for her had no care, As they hurried along to their homes at a quick pace, While the cold wind blew in the match girl’s face.
  18: 
  19: As night wore on her hands were numb with cold, And no longer her strength could her uphold, When an idea into her little head came: She’d strike a match and warm her hands at the flame.
  20: 
  21: And she lighted the match, and it burned brightly, And it helped to fill her heart with glee; And she thought she was sitting at a stove very grand; But, alas! she was found dead, with a match in her hand! Her body was found half-covered with snow, And as the people gazed thereon their hearts were full of woe; And many present let fall a burning tear Because she was found dead on the last night of the year, In that mighty city of London, wherein is plenty of gold— But, alas! their charity towards street waifs is rather cold.
  22: 
  23: But I hope the match girl’s in Heaven, beside her Saviour dear, A bright reward for all the hardships she suffered here.

[PROSE TO REMOVE - Will be deleted]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  32: 'Why is it that Poetry has never yet been subjected to that process of Dilution which has proved so advantageous  to her sister-art Music?
  33: 
  34: The Diluter gives us first a few notes of some well-known Air, then a dozen bars of his own, then a few more notes of the Air, and so on alternately:  thus saving the listener, if not from all risk of recognizing the melody at all, at least from the too-exciting  transports which it might produce in more concentrated  form.
  35: 
  36: The process is termed "setting" by Composers, and any one, that has ever experienced the emotion of being unexpectedly  set down in a heap of mortar, will recognize the truthfulness  of this happy phrase.
  37: 
  38: For truly, just as the genuine Epicure lingers lovingly over a morsel of supreme Venison--whose every fibre seems to murmer "Excelsior!"--yet swallows, ere returning to the toothsome dainty, great mouthfuls of oatmeal-porridge and winkles: and just as the perfect Connoisseur in Claret permits himself but one delicate sip, and then tosses all a pint or more of boarding-school beer: so also----'

  22: 
  23: IV Fringe upon fringe of blue crocuses, crocuses, walled against blue of themselves, blue of that upper earth, blue of the depth upon depth of flowers, lost; flowers, if I could have taken once my breath of them, enough of them, more than earth, even than of the upper earth, had passed with me beneath the earth; if I could have caught up from the earth, the whole of the flowers of the earth, if once I could have breathed into myself the very golden crocuses and the red, and the very golden hearts of the first saffron, the whole of the golden mass, the whole of the great fragrance, I could have dared the loss.
  24: 
  25: V So for your arrogance and your ruthlessness I have lost the earth   and the flowers of the earth, and the live souls above the earth, and you who passed across the light and reached ruthless; you who have your own light, who are to yourself a presence, who need no presence; yet for all your arrogance and your glance, I tell you this: such loss is no loss, such terror, such coils and strands and pitfalls of blackness, such terror is no loss; hell is no worse than your earth above the earth, hell is no worse, no, nor your flowers nor your veins of light nor your presence, a loss; my hell is no worse than yours though you pass among the flowers and speak with the spirits above earth.
  26: 
  27: VI Against the black I have more fervour than you in all the splendour of that place, against the blackness and the stark grey I have more light; and the flowers, if I should tell you, you would turn from your own fit paths toward hell, turn again and glance back and I would sink into a place even more terrible than this.
  28: 
  29: VII At least I have the flowers of myself, and my thoughts, no god can take that; I have the fervour of myself for a presence and my own spirit for light; and my spirit with its loss knows this; though small against the black, small against the formless rocks, hell must break before I am lost; before I am lost, hell must open like a red rose for the dead to pass.

 134: Although Virginia is justly famed for its Civil War battlefields, it also enjoys numerous associations with the nation's early colonial history.
 135: 
 136: The anonymous writer of this poem, which appeared in the November 1861 issue of The Southern Literary Messenger, seized upon an interesting coincidence connected with that history to take a backhanded swipe at General Winfield Scott, the first commander-in-chief of the Union Army.
 137: 
 138: The following note preceded the poem: "It is singular that Braddock and Scott should each have landed an army at the same port, invaded a country by the same road, fled from an enemy of inferior strength, and signalized themselves as the heroes of the two most complete and disastrous routs known to American history.
 139: 
 140: Edward Braddock (1695-1755) was a British general whose name is inextricably linked with the disastrous colonial loss at Fort Duquesne during the French and Indian War in 1755.
 141: 
 142: Despite being warned by staff officer George Washington that his Indian opponents preferred to attack from ambush, Braddock failed to take proper precautions and exposed his forces unnecessarily.
 143: 
 144: When the Indians opened fire from behind trees, only a few miles short of Fort Duquesne, Braddock lost more than half his troops and over three-quarters of his officers and was himself mortally wounded.
 145: 
 146: Washington led the survivors of the assault to safety.
 147: 
 148: Braddock's forces launched their campaign from the port city of Alexandria, as did Federal troops under Scott more than 100 years later in July 1861 when they followed a route similar to Braddock's on their way to a humiliating defeat at the hands of the Confederate Army at Manassas.

 168: 
 169: The connexion between the Tree of Life and the Cross of Christ has been twice wrought up into sublime dramatic poems by Calderon; once in his Auto, entitled "El Arbor del mejor Fruto;" and again in that which is indeed only the same poem in a later and more perfect form, "La Sibila del Oriente.

 171: " We have the same tradition of Seth going to the gates of Paradise in the fine old Cornish Mystery of "The Creation of the World," which was lately published with an English translation; and allusions to it are frequent in all the popular literature of the Middle Ages; see, for instance, Göthe's recension of the "Reineke Fuchs," near the beginning of the tenth book; and I remember a curious passage about it in Mandeville's "Travels.

 175: I may just observe that this poem is an attempt--I will confess a most unsuccessful one--to write English verse in the Spanish assonant rhyme, of which the principle is, that words are considered to rhyme which have the same vowel-sounds, though the consonants are different: thus, angel and raiment having the same vowel-sounds, a--e, are perfect assonant rhymes.
 176: 
 177: As in the Persian Ghazel, there is but one rhyme running through the whole poem, and in this all the alternate lines, beginning with the second, terminate: and of course the rhythmical effect of the poem is to be judged, not by any half-dozen lines apart, but by the total impression which the whole Poem continuously read leaves on the ear.

  93: He is one of the chief personages of Eastern Mythology, the ever-ready helper of the oppressed, the Genius of spring, the deliverer in peril, the admonisher of princes, the avenger of unrighteousness, the guide through the wilderness of the world, and, finally, the ever-youthful guardian of the fountain of life.

 101: On this poem I may observe, that it is the first of several in the volume written with an arrangement of rhyme hardly familiar to the English reader, which yet is that of a great part, as I believe, of the lyric poetry of the East, and which may not, perhaps, be unworthy of a place among us.
 102: 
 103: According to the laws of the Ghazel,--for poems in this metre are so entitled,--the two first lines must rhyme, and then this rhyme repeats itself in the second line of each succeeding couplet, which is, in fact, a new stanza, till the end of the poem,--the termination of the first line in each these following couplets being left free.
 104: 
 105: This single rule of the one repeated rhyme being observed, the Ghazel admits otherwise of the greatest possible variety; it may be composed, as is this present, in short trochaics, in longer or shorter iambics, or, in fact, in lines of whatsoever length or arrangement of syllables the poet will.

 243: Who, of all the English bards, has pleaded most eloquently and perseveringly the cause of the labouring millions.
 244: 
 245: In Bamford's book Homely Rhymes, Poems and Reminiscences, this poem is introduced as follows:-
 246: This Poem was first published in April, 1839; it was inscribed, as at present to the before-mentioned bard, and was addressed to "The Hand-loom Weavers of Lancashire, and the Persons styled Chartists," in the hope that the reading of the piece, with the accompanying introductory remarks, and the post-scriptum, might have some effect in counteracting the baneful influence of the Chartist demagogues, who, having wickedly devised the plan of "a National Holiday," or "Sacred Month," as they called it, were then urging their followers to attempt carrying it into effect.
 247: 
 248: Whatever of an exciting tendency was to be found in the Poem, brought with it, in the same pages, a counteracting admonition; and the author hopes it was not then, nor has been since, altogether forgotten, either by the employers or the employed.

   3: Once when I was shedding bitter tears, when, dissolved in pain, my hope was melting away, and I stood alone by the barren mound which in its narrow dark bosom hid the vanished form of my life — lonely as never yet was lonely man, driven by anxiety unspeakable — powerless, and no longer anything but a conscious misery.
   4: 
   5: — As there I looked about me for help, unable to go on or to turn back, and clung to the fleeting, extinguished life with an endless longing: — then, out of the blue distances — from the hills of my ancient bliss, came a shiver of twilight — and at once snapt the bond of birth — the chains of the Light.
   6: 
   7: Away fled the glory of the world, and with it my mourning — the sadness flowed together into a new, unfathomable world — Thou, Night-inspiration, heavenly Slumber, didst come upon me — the region gently upheaved itself; over it hovered my unbound, newborn spirit.
   8: 
   9: The mound became a cloud of dust — and through the cloud I saw the glorified face of my beloved.

  11: In her eyes eternity reposed — I laid hold of her hands, and the tears became a sparkling bond that could not be broken.

   3: Cecil Touchon’s work is radically post-textual, yet encumbered by nothing but text and the space surrounding it.
   4: 
   5: His technique, as demonstrated aptly here, is to dismantle physical pages of text and reconstitute them in ways that enhance the visual continuities of text and undermine their meaningful sequentiality.
   6: 
   7: This is the ultimate form of deconstruction, a literal (in the hand, of the letter) slicing of the page into pieces that Touchon repositions into a new jigsaw puzzle, different than the one that he began with.
   8: 
   9: This piece is particularly austere, presenting only three colors for our consideration: a mottled white, a red-brown, and a glimpse of black peeking through from the base of the collage.
  10: 
  11: We are invited to consider this poem as a piece of writing transmogrified into a visual field through which we might glimpse what it means to be text, to understand text, and to inhabit text.

   9: The Tilt-A-Whirl is the angle his head tilts when the Flirt Program goes into effect, usually in the vicinity of a Cindy or a Carrie, though once he found himself tilting at the school librarian which caused him to wheel in reverse into the Civil War section knocking over a cart of books that were waiting to be shelved under B.

 569: A caution must also be given to the understanding against the intemperance which systems of philosophy manifest in giving or withholding assent; because intemperance of this kind seems to establish Idols and in some sort to perpetuate them, leaving no way open to reach and dislodge them.
 570: 
 571: This excess is of two kinds: the first being manifest in those who are ready in deciding, and render sciences dogmatic and magisterial; the other in those who deny that we can know anything, and so introduce a wandering kind of inquiry that leads to nothing; of which kinds the former subdues, the latter weakens the understanding.
 572: 
 573: For the philosophy of Aristotle, after having by hostile confutations destroyed all the rest (as the Ottomans serve their brothers), has laid down the law on all points; which done, he proceeds himself to raise new questions of his own suggestion, and dispose of them likewise; so that nothing may remain that is not certain and decided: a practice which holds and is in use among his successors.
 574: 
 575: The school of Plato, on the other hand, introduced Acatalepsia, at first in jest and irony, and in disdain of the older sophists, Protagoras, Hippias, and the rest, who were of nothing else so much ashamed as of seeming to doubt about anything.
 576: 
 577: But the New Academy made a dogma of it, and held it as a tenet.
 578: 
 579: And though their's is a fairer seeming way than arbitrary decisions; since they say that they by no means destroy all investigation, like Pyrrho and his Refrainers, but allow of some things to be followed as probable, though of none to be maintained as true; yet still when the human mind has once despaired of finding truth, its interest in all things grows fainter; and the result is that men turn aside to pleasant disputations and discourses and roam as it were from object to object, rather than keep on a course of severe inquisition.
 580: 
 581: But, as I said at the beginning and am ever urging, the human senses and understanding, weak as they are, are not to be deprived of their authority, but to be supplied with helps.

 585: So much concerning the several classes of Idols, and their equipage: all of which must be renounced and put away with a fixed and solemn determination, and the understanding thoroughly freed and cleansed; the entrance into the kingdom of man, founded on the sciences, being not much other than the entrance into the kingdom of heaven, whereinto none may enter except as a little child.

  30: 
  31: Those tiny dimples one sees on pretty women’s chins and cheeks could also be seen on her dainty buttocks, whose softness was softer than that of a mill mouse born and raised in flour, and that nuns limbs were all so smooth that a hand placed gently on her loins would have slid down her leg as quickly as a foot slides on ice, and hair no more dared grow on her than it would on an egg.

  37: And to be doubly sure that his nail would be driven more tightly into her slit, he motioned to his back and his favorite punk pulled his breeches down to his heels and applied his clyster to the reverend’s visibilium, while all the time the General himself kept his eyes fixed on the two other young louts, who, having settled the sisters neatly and comfortably on the bed, were now pounding the sauce in the mortar to the great despair of the last little sister.

  62: 
  63: Seamus Heaney gave a talk at Silkeborg Museum in 1996, where he described his childhood memories of the bog:
  64: "When I was a child and an adolescent I lived among peat-diggers and I also worked in the peat bog myself.
  65: 
  66: I loved the structure the peat bank revealed after the spade had worked its way through the surface of the peat.
  67: 
  68: I loved the mystery and silence of the place when the work was done at the end of the day and I would stand there alone while the larks became quiet and the lapwings started calling, while a snipe would suddenly take off and disappear.
  69: 
  70: 
  71: About his poem - Bogland - Seamus Heaney told the following: "The title of the poem refers to the bogs I knew while I was growing up and the stories I had heard about the things that could be preserved in the bog such as supplies of butter that were kept there, and about the things that were even more astonishing to a child, such as the skeleton of an Irish elk which our neighbours had dug out".

  10:

  20: 
  21: If she’d laughed   squealing he might still take her swimming   & his mother wouldn’t say she’s crazy, she would   not have got her teeth into his shoulder till   well yes she bit him, and the marks lasted & lasted, his mother said so,   but that couldn’t be in a novel.

  24: 
  25: Biting is embarrassing and wrong & she has no intention of doing it again   but she would if he did if he dared, and there’s no story if there’s no hope of change.

  12: 
  13: He has also written about the Bards of the Bible, Which occupied nearly three years in which he was not idle, Because when he sits down to write he does it with might and main, And to get an interview with him it would be almost vain, And in that he is always right, For the Bible tells us whatever your hands findeth to do, Do it with all your might.

   1: The Little Match Girl
   2: 
   3: It was biting cold, and the falling snow, Which filled a poor little match girl’s heart with woe, Who was bareheaded and barefooted, as she went along the street, Crying, “Who’ll buy my matches?

   5: for I want pennies to buy some meat!” When she left home she had slippers on; But, alas! poor child, now they were gone.
   6: 
   7: For she lost both of them while hurrying across the street, Out of the way of two carriages which were near by her feet.
   8: 
   9: So the little girl went on, while the snow fell thick and fast; And the child’s heart felt cold and downcast, For nobody had bought any matches that day, Which filled her little mind with grief and dismay.
  10: 
  11: Alas! she was hungry and shivering with cold; So in a corner between two houses she made bold To take shelter from the violent storm.
  12: 
  13: Poor little waif! wishing to herself she’d never been born.
  14: 
  15: And she grew colder and colder, and feared to go home For fear of her father beating her; and she felt woe-begone Because she could carry home no pennies to buy bread, And to go home without pennies she was in dread.
  16: 
  17: The large flakes of snow covered her ringlets of fair hair; While the passers-by for her had no care, As they hurried along to their homes at a quick pace, While the cold wind blew in the match girl’s face.
  18: 
  19: As night wore on her hands were numb with cold, And no longer her strength could her uphold, When an idea into her little head came: She’d strike a match and warm her hands at the flame.
  20: 
  21: And she lighted the match, and it burned brightly, And it helped to fill her heart with glee; And she thought she was sitting at a stove very grand; But, alas! she was found dead, with a match in her hand! Her body was found half-covered with snow, And as the people gazed thereon their hearts were full of woe; And many present let fall a burning tear Because she was found dead on the last night of the year, In that mighty city of London, wherein is plenty of gold— But, alas! their charity towards street waifs is rather cold.
  22: 
  23: But I hope the match girl’s in Heaven, beside her Saviour dear, A bright reward for all the hardships she suffered here.

   3: As I stood upon London Bridge and viewed the mighty throng Of thousands of people in cabs and ’busses rapidly whirling along, All furiously driving to and fro, Up one street and down another as quick as they could go: Then I was struck with the discordant sound of human voices there, Which seemed to me like wild geese cackling in the air: And the river Thames is a most beautiful sight, To see the steamers sailing upon it by day and by night.
   4: 
   5: And the Tower of London is most gloomy to behold, And the crown of England lies there, begemmed with precious stones and gold; King Henry the Sixth was murdered there by the Duke of Glo’ster, And when he killed him with his sword he called him an impostor.

  12: 
  13: Then there’s two beautiful water-fountains spouting up very high, Where the weary traveller can drink when he feels dry; And at the foot of the monument there’s three bronze lions in grand array, Enough to make the stranger’s heart throb with dismay.
  14: 
  15: Then there’s Mr Spurgeon, a great preacher, which no one dare gainsay, I went to hear him preach on the Sabbath-day, And he made my heart feel light and gay, When I heard him preach and pray.
  16: 
  17: And the Tabernacle was crowded from ceiling to floor, And many were standing outside the door; He is an eloquent preacher I honestly declare, And I was struck with admiration as on him I did stare.
  18: 
  19: Then there’s Petticoat Lane I venture to say, It’s a wonderful place on the Sabbath-day; There wearing-apparel can be bought to suit the young or old, For the ready cash, silver, coppers, or gold.
  20: 
  21: Oh! mighty city of London! you are wonderful to see, And thy beauties no doubt fill the tourist’s heart with glee; But during my short stay, and while wandering there, Mr Spurgeon was the only man I heard speaking proper English I do declare.

   3: On the Gilfillan burial day, In the Hill o’ Balgay, It was a most solemn sight to see, Not fewer than thirty thousand people assembled in Dundee, All watching the funeral procession of Gilfillan that day, That death had suddenly taken away, And was going to be buried in the Hill o’ Balgay.
   4: 
   5: There were about three thousand people in the procession alone, And many were shedding tears, and several did moan, And their bosoms heaved with pain, Because they knew they would never look upon his like again.
   6: 
   7: There could not be fewer than fifty carriages in the procession that day, And gentlemen in some of them that had come from far away, And in whispers some of them did say, As the hearse bore the precious corpse away, Along the Nethergate that day.
   8: 
   9: I’m sure he will be greatly missed by the poor, For he never turned them empty-handed away from his door; And to assist them in distress it didn’t give him pain, And I’m sure the poor will never look upon his like again.
  10: 
  11: On the Gilfillan burial day, in the Hill o’ Balgay, There was a body of policemen marshalled in grand array, And marched in front of the procession all the way; Also the relatives and friends of the deceas’d, Whom I hope from all sorrows has been releas’d, And whose soul I hope to heaven has fled away, To sing with saints above for ever and aye.
  12: 
  13: The Provost, Magistrates, and Town Council were in the procession that day; Also Mrs Gilfillan, who cried and sobbed all the way For her kind husband, that was always affable and gay, Which she will remember until her dying day.
  14: 
  15: When the procession arrived in the Hill o’ Balgay, The people were almost as hush as death, and many of them did say— As long as we live we’ll remember the day That the great Gilfillan was buried in the Hill o’Balgay.
  16: 
  17: When the body of the great Gilfillan was lowered into the grave, ’Twas then the people’s hearts with sorrow did heave; And with tearful eyes and bated breath, Mrs Gilfillan lamented her loving husband’s death.
  18: 
  19: Then she dropped a ringlet of immortelles into his grave, Then took one last fond look, and in sorrow did leave; And all the people left with sad hearts that day, And that ended the Gilfillan burial in the Hill o’ Balgay.

 220: The poem shows traces of the Persian Sufi style and is patterned, to some extent, on the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam.
 221: 
 222: Bachchan, who has translated the Rubaiyat into Hindi, has acknowledged the Persian influence in his work and indeed it is this aspect of his poetry that sets it apart form the work of the major Hindi poets of our time.
 223: 
 224: The range of the 135 verses of Madhushala is wide: wine and the tavern or wine-house serve as the basic metaphors in the poem and symbolise the fillness
 225: and intoxication of life as well as its pain and frustration.
 226: 
 227: Love, Beauty, Pain, Sorrow, Death --- all of these and more are woven into the rich texture
 228: of the poem.
 229: 
 230: Madhushala embodies the entire philosophy of Bachchan: the passionate yearning of the soul for beauty ending only in frustration, the pathetic scarcity and transience of beauty in the world, the agony of disillusionment, the inevitability of death and a stoic acceptance of fatalism as the only armour for the soul -- these are the themes of not only Madhushalabut of all of Bachchan's poetry.

   3: Yesterday I found my pipe while pondering a long evening of work, of fine winter work.
   4: 
   5: Thrown aside were my cigarettes, with all the childish joys of summer, into the past which the leaves shining blue in the sun, the muslins, illuminate, and taken up once again was the grave pipe of a serious man who wants to smoke for a long while without being disturbed, so as better to work: but I was not prepared for the surprise that this abandoned object had in store for me; for hardly had I drawn the first puff when I forgot the grand books I was planning to write, and, amazed, moved to a feeling of tenderness, I breathed in the air of the previous winter which was now coming back to me.
   6: 
   7: I had not been in contact with my faithful sweetheart since returning to France, and now all of London, London as I had lived it a year ago entirely alone, appeared before my eyes: first the dear fogs that muffle one’s brains and have an odor of their own there when they penetrate beneath the casements.
   8: 
   9: My tobacco had the scent of a somber room with leather furniture sprinkled by coal dust, on which the thin black cat would curl and stretch; the big fires! and the maid with red arms pouring coals, and the noise of those coals falling from the sheet-iron bucket into the iron scuttle in the morning—when the postman gave the solemn double knock that kept me alive! Once again I saw through the windows those sickly trees of the deserted square—I saw the open sea, crossed so often that winter, shivering on the deck of the steamer wet with drizzle and blackened from the fumes—with my poor wandering beloved, decked out in traveller’s clothes, a long dress, dull as the dust of the roads, a coat clinging damply to her cold shoulders, one of those straw hats with no feather and hardly any ribbons that wealthy ladies throw away upon arrival, mangled as they are by the sea, and that poor loved ones refurbish for many another season.
  10: 
  11: Around her neck was wound the terrible handkerchief that one waves when saying goodbye forever.

1050: A critique on Wordsworth's Peter Bell reached us at Leghorn, which amused Shelley exceedingly, and suggested this poem.
1051: 
1052: I need scarcely observe that nothing personal to the author of Peter Bell is intended in this poem.
1053: 
1054: No man ever admired Wordsworth's poetry more; -- he read it perpetually, and taught others to appreciate its beauties.
1055: 
1056: This poem is, like all others written by Shelley, ideal.
1057: 
1058: He conceived the idealism of a poet -- a man of lofty and creative genius -- quitting the glorious calling of discovering and announcing the beautiful and good, to support and propagate ignorant prejudices and pernicious errors; imparting to the unenlightened, not that ardour for truth and spirit of toleration which Shelley looked on as the sources of the moral improvement and happiness of mankind, but false and injurious opinions, that evil was good, and that ignorance and force were the best allies of purity and virtue.
1059: 
1060: His idea was that a man gifted, even as transcendently as the author of Peter Bell, with the highest qualities of genius, must, if he fostered such errors, be infected with dulness.
1061: 
1062: This poem was written as a warning -- not as a narration of the reality.
1063: 
1064: He was unaquainted personally with Wordsworth or with Coleridge (to whom he alludes in the fifth part of the poem), and therefore, I repeat, his poem is purely ideal; -- it contains something of criticism on the compositions of those great poets, but nothing injurious to the men themselves.
1065: 
1066: No poem contains more of Shelley's peculiar views with regard to the errors into which many of the wisest have fallen, and the pernicious effects of certain opinions on society.
1067: 
1068: Much of it is beautifully written: and, though, like the burlesque drama of Swellfoot, it must be looked on as a plaything, it has so much merit and poetry -- so much of himself in it -- that it cannot failt to interest greatly, and by right belongs to the world for those whose instruction and benefit it was written.

 970: 
 971: The peasantry are a handsome intelligent race; and there was a gladsome sunny heaven spread over us, that rendered home and every scene we visited cheerful and bright.
 972: 
 973: During some of the hottest days of August, Shelley made a solitary journey on foot to the summit of Monte San Pellegrino -- a mountain of some height, on the top of which there is a chapel, the object, during certain days of the year, of many pilgrimages.
 974: 
 975: The excursion delighted him while it lasted; though he exerted himself too much, and the effect was considerable lsasitude and weakness on his return.
 976: 
 977: During the expedition he conceived the idea, and wrote, in the three days immediately succeeding to his return, the Witch of Atlas.
 978: 
 979: This poem is peculiarly characteristic of his tastes -- wildly fanciful, full of brilliant imagery, and discarding human interest and passion, to revel in the fantastic ideas that his imagination suggested.

 894: Shelley: 'From the Baths of Lucca, in 1818, Shelley visited Venice; and, circumstances rendering it eligible that we should remain a few weeks in the neighbourhood of that city, he accepted the offer of Lord Byron, who lent him the use of a villa he rented near Este; and he sent for his family from Lucca to join him.
 895: 
 896: I Capuccini was a villa built on the site of a Capuchin convent, demolished when the French suppressed religious houses; it was situated on the very overhanging brow of a low hill at the foot of a range of higher ones.
 897: 
 898: The house was cheerful and pleasant; a vine-trellised walk, a pergola, as it is called in Italian, led from the hall-door to a summer-house at the end of the garden, which Shelley made his study, and in which he began the Prometheus; and here also, as he mentions in a letter, he wrote Julian and Maddalo.
 899: 
 900: A slight ravine, with a road in its depth, divided the garden from the hill, on which stood the ruins of the ancient castle of Este, whose dark massive wall gave forth an echo, and from whose ruined crevices owls and bats flitted forth at night, as the crescent moon sunk behind the black and heavy battlements.
 901: 
 902: We looked from the garden over the wide plain of Lombardy, bounded to the west by the far Apennines, while to the east the horizon was lost in misty distance.
 903: 
 904: After the picturesque but limited view of mountain, ravine, and chestnutwood, at the Baths of Lucca, there was something infinitely gratifying to the eye in the wide range of prospect commanded by our new abode.

  11: And so it began: the earth torn, split open by a dirt road cutting through palmettos and wild tamarind trees defending the land against the sun.
  12: 
  13: Beside the road, a shack leaning into the wind, on the wooden porch, crates of avocados and limes, white chickens pecking at the floor boards, and a man under the shadow of his straw hat, staring into the camera in 1914.
  14: 
  15: He doesn't know within a lifetime the unclaimed land behind him will be cleared of scrub and sawgrass, the soil will be turned, made to give back what the farmers wish, their lonely houses will stand acres apart from one another, jailed behind the boughs of their orchards.
  16: 
  17: He'll never buy sugar at the general store, mail love letters at the post office, or take a train at the depot of the town that will rise out of hundred-million years of coral rock on promises of paradise.
  18: 
  19: He'll never ride a Model-T puttering down the dirt road that will be paved over, stretch farther and farther west into the horizon, reaching for the setting sun after which it will be named.
  20: 
  21: He can't even begin to imagine the shadows of buildings rising taller than the palm trees, the street lights glowing like counterfeit stars dotting the sky above the road, the thousands who will take the road everyday, who'll also call this place home less than a hundred years after the photograph of him hanging today in City Hall as testament.
  22: 
  23: He'll never meet me, the engineer hired to transform the road again, bring back tree shadows and birdsongs, build another promise of another paradise meant to last another forever.
  24: 
  25: He'll never see me, the poet standing before him, trying to read his mind across time, wondering if he was thinking what I'm today, both of us looking down the road that will stretch on for years after I too disappear into a photo.

  10: 
  11: And you are the one, old ladies fated from birth to ugliness, obesity and dearth, who sat beside my path one day as I flashed by.
  12: 
  13: And you are the one, all tumble-down shacks in disregarded hills and animals the car on the road kills and leaves stinking in the sun.

   3: Never anymore in a wash of sweetness and awe  does the summer when I was seventeen come back  to mind against my will, like a bird crossing  my vision.
   4: 
   5: Summer of moist nights full of girls  and boys ripened, holy drunkenness and violation  of the comic boundaries, defiances that never  failed or brought disaster.
   6: 
   7: Days on the backs  and in the breath of horses, between rivers  and pools that reflected the cicadas' whine,  enervation and strength creeping in smooth waves  over muscular water.
   8: 
   9: All those things accepted,  once, with unnoticing hunger, as an infant  accepts the nipple, never come back to mind  against the will.
  10: 
  11: What comes unsummoned now,  blotting out every other thought and image,  is a part of the past not so deep or far away:  the time of poverty, of struggle to find means  not hateful—the muddy seedtime of early manhood.
  12: 
  13: What returns are those moments in the diner  night after night with each night's one cup of coffee,  watching an old man, who always at the same hour  came in and smiled, ordered his tea and opened  his drawing pad.

  19: Those days, that studious worker,  hand moving and eyes eager in the sour light,  that artist always in the same worn-out suit,  are my nostalgia now.
  20: 
  21: That old man comes back,  the friend I saw each day and never spoke to,  because I hoped soon to disappear from there,  as I have disappeared, into the heaven of better days.

   3: At the table, at the grave not knowing whether to grieve or celebrate, they seemed to find a way within the stalled noon clatter and the dusk over oily swamps and elder tangle along a locked stockade of heavy machines, as the blue heron, looking down, flew farther on.

   3: the Cold War just ended    a lone sun in the belly of the flying bird white sails drift into an alternate river of  time    all languages circulate against the state of enslavement    my identity suspect    exile is crossing the void of a journey without a destination—my life
   4: intoxicated—tram gently rocks through the center of  Vienna whisky bottle polished off in a room in Stockholm    I make ghostly faces in the mirror    a South African poet a French poet and I belt out “The Internationale” on Osborne Street    adjusting pace to march straight into first light
   5: the moon is my mother    softly smooth out those secret slips of paper the birth of suffering flashes to mind    precisely because of life’s incompleteness it completes itself    the defensive line of the fathers turns into forest    a chainsaw screams out of human will    behind the cemetery the city glitters and shines
   6: the setting sun and an elegy for the twentieth-century    scattered chronicles and crossed-out blacklists    the wave that has yet to form has already transmigrated     postwar flags ceaselessly change colors meanings that survive underground draw water    from the cracks between words spit out the bubbles    collect postage stamps collect shards of thought    butterflies flutter above a forgotten line of defense
   7: I am Celan in 1947    crossing the border from Bucharest to Vienna the smuggler has the smell of a skunk    North Star of my childhood leads the way    no identity card except a manuscript of poems overnight at an abandoned train station    a stooped shadow stalks through the starlight    German the enemy of the mother tongueit is now time  for stone to bloom
   8: I dream of a raging storm    a forest as if a crazed herd of  horses whirls me away    embrace a pillow in the clouds    hug the family tightly waves crash against the port side of a battered wooden boat    moss blindfolds the rocks    perch on the branch of language    coffins of war or epidemic take flight    shadows in the field dig up potatoes to prepare for winter
   9: searching for an unfamiliar city in which I can be reborn    crow-black clouds bow their heads to smell the tobacco leaves    the sea leaves a watermark on banknotes    angels on the gallery walls fly away in a hurry    the bronze statue on the public square overflows with hostility    time is like walking a dog bounding prancing running wildly swiftly stops and turns the corner    scratches an itch against a tree then pees and moves on and on    without a leash

1187: It would be very flattering to me, if I might hope that the little Tale, which I now take the liberty of presenting to you, could amuse a few moments of your tedious indisposition.
1188: 
1189: It is, I confess, but a paltry return for the many hours of agreeable information and elegant amusement which I have received from your spirited and very entertaining writings: yet I am persuaded, that you will receive it with favour, as a small offering of esteem and gratitude; as an offering of which the intention alone makes all the little value.
1190: 
1191: The slight verses, Sir, which I place under your protection, will not, I fear, impress the world with a very favourable idea of my poetical powers: But I shall, at least, be suspected of having some taste, and of keeping good company, when I confess that some of the pleasantest hours of my life have been passed in your conversation.
1192: 
1193: I should be unjust to your very engaging and well-bred turn of wit, if I did not declare that, among all the lively and brilliant things I have heard from you, I do not remember ever to have heard an unkind or an ungenerous one.
1194: 
1195: Let me be allowed to bear my feeble testimony to your temperate use of this charming faculty, so delightful in itself, but which can only be safely trusted in such hands as yours, where it is guarded by politeness, and directed by humanity.
1196: 
1197: I have the honour to be,
1198: SIR,
1199: Your much obliged
1200: And most obedient,
1201: Humble Servant,
1202: THE AUTHOR.
