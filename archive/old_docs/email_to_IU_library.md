# Email to IU Library - TDM Access for Historical Corpora

**To:** digschol@iu.edu
**Subject:** TDM Access Request: ECCO, NCCO, and English Poetry Archive

---

Dear Digital Scholarship Services,

I'm a postdoctoral researcher at Indiana University's Center for Possible Minds, working on computational historical formalism. I'm training period-specific BERT models on historical English corpora (1595-2000) to analyze formal literary features across centuries.

I'm requesting text data mining (TDM) access for three ProQuest resources:

**1. ECCO (Eighteenth Century Collections Online) via Gale Digital Scholar Lab**
Need: Access to Gale Digital Scholar Lab for ECCO content to enable text and data mining
Purpose: Train BERT model on 18th-century English language patterns (non-commercial research)

**2. NCCO (Nineteenth Century Collections Online) via Gale Digital Scholar Lab**
Note: I see IU has NCCO access (https://libraries.indiana.edu/nineteenth-century-collections-online)
Need: Access to Gale Digital Scholar Lab for NCCO content to enable text and data mining
Purpose: Train BERT model on 19th-century English language patterns (non-commercial research)

**3. English Poetry Archive**
Need: TDM rights and bulk download access
Purpose: Supplement unified poetry database for genre-specific model training

**Research Context:**
I've completed BERT training on EEBO (1595-1700) and am currently training on a 5.5M-line poetry corpus. I need these additional historical corpora to complete temporal coverage for my three-layer model architecture:
- Layer 1: Period-specific historical language models (EEBO, ECCO, NCCO, 20th-century)
- Layer 2: Poetry-specialized model (unified poetry database)
- Layer 3: Prosody-conditioned embeddings

**Technical Requirements:**
- Gale Digital Scholar Lab access (designed for computational text analysis)
- Ability to download up to 5,000 documents per session for model training
- Non-commercial academic research use (BERT model training for dissertation)

**Timeline:**
Ongoing dissertation research; these corpora will support computational analysis of ~6.2M lines of poetry across 400+ years.

I'd appreciate guidance on:
1. Whether IU has institutional access to Gale Digital Scholar Lab
2. If so, how to request researcher credentials for ECCO and NCCO datasets
3. If not, whether IU can add Digital Scholar Lab to our institutional subscriptions
4. Alternative TDM options for the English Poetry Archive

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,

## Notes

**KEY FINDING from Gale Terms of Use:**
- Regular NCCO/ECCO access: TDM is PROHIBITED
- Gale Digital Scholar Lab: TDM is ALLOWED for non-commercial research
- Digital Scholar Lab allows: 5,000 documents per session download
- Explicitly permits training models (BERT) for academic research
- Text snippets for distribution limited to 200 chars (but full text downloadable for analysis)

**Resources to request:**
- ✅ ECCO via Digital Scholar Lab (1700-1800)
- ✅ NCCO via Digital Scholar Lab (1800-1900)
- ✅ English Poetry Archive - need TDM rights

**Already have:**
- EEBO BERT (1595-1700) ✓ trained
- Gutenberg poetry corpus ✓ 50% trained
- HathiTrust access for 20th century

**What Digital Scholar Lab provides:**
- Web interface for computational text analysis
- Download capabilities for model training
- Compliance with copyright for non-commercial research
- Session-based download limits (5K documents per session = can do multiple sessions)

**Expected response:**
- May already have institutional Digital Scholar Lab access
- If not, library may need to add it to subscription
- Could take 3-5 business days for access setup
- Alternative: They may suggest HTRC for bulk downloads
