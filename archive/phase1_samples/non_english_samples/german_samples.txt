--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Genesis BK IV ll. 169-191)…. It did not seem good to the Lord of heaven that Adam should longer be alone as warden and keeper of this new Paradise. Wherefore the King, Almighty God, wrought him an helpmeet; the Author of life made woman and brought her unto the man whom He loved. He took the stuff of Adam's body, and secretly drew forth a rib from his side. He was fast asleep in peaceful slumber; he knew no pain nor any pang; there came no blood from out the wound, but the Lord of angels drew forth from his body a growing rib, and the man was unhurt. Of this God fashioned a lovely maid, breathing into her life and an eternal soul. They were like unto the angels. The bride of Adam was a living spirit. By God's might both were born into the world in the loveliness of youth. They knew no sin nor any evil, but in the hearts of both there burned the love of God. (ll. 192-195) Then the Gracious King, Lord of all human kind, blessed these two, male and female, man and wife, and spake this word: (ll. 196-205) "Be fruitful and

The Ministers of State Then presnly I sor, They gallops to the Pallis gate, In carridges and for. With anxious looks intent, Before the gate they stop, There comes the good Lord President, And there the Archbishopp. Lord John he next elights; And who comes here in haste?

Says Mrs. L. to the Duke, "Your Grace, it is A PRINCE. And at that nuss's bold rebuke, He did both laugh and wince. He vews with pleasant look This pooty flower of May, Then, says the wenarable Duke, "Egad, it's my buthday.

Die Kleine Passion Der sonnige Duft, Semptemberluft, sie wehten ein Mücklein mir aufs Buch. Das suchte sich die Ruhegruft und fern vom Wald sein Leichentuch. Vier Flügelein von Seiden fein trug's auf dem Rücken zart, drin man im Regenbogenschein spielendes Licht gewahrt! Hellgrün das schlanke Leibchen war, hellgrün der Füßchen dreifach Paar, und auf dem Köpfchen wundersam saß ein Federbüschchen stramm; die Äuglein wie ein goldnes Erz glänzten mir in das tiefste Herz. Dies zierliche und manierliche Wesen hatt' sich zu Gruft und Leichentuch das glänzende Papier erlesen, darin ich las, ein dichterliches Buch; so ließ den Band ich aufgeschlagen und sah erstaunt dem Sterben zu, wie langsam, langsam ohne Klagen das Tierlein kam zu seiner Ruh. Drei Tage ging es müd und matt umher auf dem Papiere; die Flügelein von Seide fein, sie glänzten alle viere. Am vierten Tage stand es still gerade auf dem Wörtlein "will"! Gar tapfer stand's auf selbem Raum, hob je ein Füßchen wie im Traum; am fünften Tage legt' es sich, doch noch am sechsten regt' es sich; am siebten endlich siegt' der Tod, da war zu Ende seine Not. Nun ruht im Buch sein leicht Gebein, mög' uns sein Frieden eigen sein!

Beowulf (Episode 17) THEN hastened those heroes their home to see, friendless, to find the Frisian land, houses and high burg. Hengest still through the death-dyed winter dwelt with Finn, holding pact, yet of home he minded, though powerless his ring-decked prow to drive over the waters, now waves rolled fierce lashed by the winds, or winter locked them in icy fetters. Then fared another year to men's dwellings, as yet they do, the sunbright skies, that their season ever duly await. Far off winter was driven; fair lay earth's breast; and fain was the rover, the guest, to depart, though more gladly he pondered on wreaking his vengeance than roaming the deep, and how to hasten the hot encounter where sons of the Frisians were sure to be. So he escaped not the common doom, when Hun with "Lafing," the light-of-battle, best of blades, his bosom pierced: its edge was famed with the Frisian earls. On fierce-heart Finn there fell likewise, on himself at home, the horrid sword-death; for Guthlaf and Oslaf of grim attack had sorrowing told, from sea-ways landed, mourning their woes. Finn's wavering spirit bode not in breast. The burg was reddened with blood of foemen,

Little Willie When Willie was a little boy, No more than five or six, Right constantly he did annoy His mother with his tricks. Yet not a picayune cared I For what he did or said, Unless, as happened frequently, The rascal wet the bed. Closely he cuddled up to me, And put his hands in mine, Till all at once I seemed to be Afloat in seas of brine. Sabean odors clogged the air, And filled my soul with dread, Yet I could only grin and bear When Willie wet the bed. 'Tis many times that rascal has Soaked all the bedclothes through, Whereat I'd feebly light the gas And wonder what to do. Yet there he lay, so peaceful like; God bless his curly head, I quite forgave the little tyke For wetting of the bed. Ah me, those happy days have flown. My boy's a father, too, And little Willies of his own Do what he used to do. And I! Ah, all that's left for me Is dreams of pleasure fled! Our boys ain't what they used to be When Willie wet the bed.

A Ballad upon a Wedding I tell thee, Dick, where I have been, Where I the rarest things have seen, O, things without compare! Such sights again cannot be found In any place on English ground, Be it at wake or fair. At Charing Cross, hard by the way Where we, thou know'st, do sell our hay, There is a house with stairs; And there did I see coming down Such folks as are not in our town, Forty at least, in pairs. Amongst the rest, one pest'lent fine (His beard no bigger, though, than thine) Walked on before the rest: Our landlord looks like nothing to him; The King (God bless him!) 'twould undo him, Should he go still so dressed. At course-a-park, without all doubt, He should have first been taken out By all the maids i' th' town: Though lusty Roger there had been, Or little George upon the Green, Or Vincent of the Crown. But wot you what? the youth was going To make an end of all his wooing; The Parson for him stayed. Yet, by his leave, for all his haste, He did not so much wish all past, Perchance, as did the maid.

No word could rouse you, though What made the princess stir was One blossom from the apple bough. Sleep solid, without care. No word can sense what pain may be In Snowmaid's icy sting, Or blossom falling from tree. With dumb pages in unwritten books Let heart stay vague and blanched: You'll never see how it really snowed, Or the blossom dropped from its branch. It seems we're not to meet too soon. So, the blossom will not fall. Sleep soundly, snow princess. Now no one will wake you, ever at all.

"Go to sleep my little baby, Go to sleep," mamma would say; "Oh, will not my little lady Go to sleep for ma to-day. Oh! my parents loved me dearly, For I was their eldest born, And they always called me Julia In a mild and loving form. My parents will not forget me, Though I married and left their home, For they can remember clearly How with them I once did roam. Oh! my mother, how I love her, Though her head is growing gray, For in fancy I can see her Bending o'er me night and day, As she did when I was little, Watching me in sleep and play — Mother now is growing feeble, Now I will her love repay. Oh! my father, how I love him, For he has worked hard for me, For to earn my food and clothing, In my little infancy. And oh, I will not forget him, While on earth I do remain — May the God of

The King Of Terrors I. As a shadow He flew, but sorrow and wail Came up from his path, like the moan of the gale. His quiver was full, though his arrows fell fast As the sharp hail of winter when urged by the blast. He smiled on each shaft as it flew from the string, Though feathered by fate, and the lightning its wing. Unerring, unsparing, it sped to its mark, As the mandate of destiny, certain and dark. The mail of the warrior it severed in twain,-- The wall of the castle it shivered amain: No shield could shelter, no prayer could save, And Love's holy shrine no immunity gave. A babe in the cradle--its mother bent o'er,-- The arrow is sped,--and that babe is no more! At the faith-plighting altar, a lovely one bows,-- The gem on her finger,--in Heaven her vows; Unseen is the blow, but she sinks in the crowd, And her bright wedding-garment is turned to a shroud! II. On flew the Destroyer, o'er mountain and main,-- And where there was life, there, there are the slain! No valley so deep, no islet so lone, But his shadow is cast, and his victims are

Sonnet. Written Upon The Top Of Ben Nevis Read me a lesson, Muse, and speak it loud Upon the top of Nevis, blind in mist! I look into the chasms, and a shroud Vapourous doth hide them, -- just so much I wist Mankind do know of hell; I look o'erhead, And there is sullen mist, -- even so much Mankind can tell of heaven; mist is spread Before the earth, beneath me, -- even such, Even so vague is man's sight of himself! Here are the craggy stones beneath my feet,-- Thus much I know that, a poor witless elf, I tread on them, -- that all my eye doth meet Is mist and crag, not only on this height, But in the world of thought and mental might! 'At Oban, apparently on the 26th of July, the decision was taken by Keats and Brown to rest in their travels "a day or two" before pushing on to Fort William and Inverness. I find no precise record of the date of the ascent of Ben Nevis; but it was probably about the 1st of August 1818. Lord Houghton says in the Life, Letters &c. , where this sonnet first

A Dream Of Bric-A-Brac I dreamed I was in fair Niphon. Amid tea-fields I journeyed on, Reclined in my jinrikishaw; Across the rolling plains I saw The lordly Fusi-yama rise, His blue cone lost in bluer skies. At last I bade my bearers stop Before what seemed a china-shop. I roused myself and entered in. A fearful joy, like some sweet sin, Pierced through my bosom as I gazed, Entranced, transported, and amazed. For all the house was but one room, And in its clear and grateful gloom, Filled with all odors strange and strong That to the wondrous East belong, I saw above, around, below, A sight to make the warm heart glow, And leave the eager soul no lack, An endless wealth of bric-a-brac. I saw bronze statues, old and rare, Fashioned by no mere mortal skill, With robes that fluttered in the air, Blown out by Art's eternal will; And delicate ivory netsukes, Richer in tone than Cheddar cheese, Of saints and hermits, cats and dogs, Grim warriors and ecstatic frogs. And here and there those wondrous masks, More living flesh than sandal-wood, Where the full soul in pleasure basks And dreams of love, the only good.

Vae Victis Beside the placid sea that mirrored her With the old glory of dawn that cannot die, The sleeping city began to moan and stir, As one that fain from an ill dream would fly; Yet more she feared the daylight bringing nigh Such dreams as know not sunrise, soon or late,--- Visions of honour lost and power gone by, Of loyal valour betrayed by factious hate, And craven sloth that shrank from the labour of forging fate. They knew and knew not, this bewildered crowd, That up her streets in silence hurrying passed, What manner of death should make their anguish loud, What corpse across the funeral pyre be cast, For none had spoken it; only, gathering fast As darkness gathers at noon in the sun's eclipse, A shadow of doom enfolded them, vague and vast, And a cry was heard, unfathered of earthly lips, "What of the ships, O Carthage? Carthage, what of the ships?

Gate Everyone has a cousin Benjamin Bunny. Peter said a walk would do him good. The edge of the wood. Peter did not enjoy himself anymore. He never would again. The brooding lettuces in their falcon hoods. The coppice gate wound shut by weeds, the jaws of life trying to keep it closed tight but anyone can climb it. As a child I played on a gate in a neighborhood park that swung of itself and sounded like the distress call of a rabbit. I stood on the bottom slat and backed in and out of the air. I’ll never get out of here. The gate was pure folly, without fencing on either side, Greek tragedy staged around a doorway the imagination strains to enter. I was raised in an aisle seat with an eye line of an actor about to come through from behind it. Melodramatic onions grew wild. I cried and cried until someone said it’s okay to cry, it means the onions are fresh. Every dream begins with a threshold. Meat in the driveway where dogs tipped the garbage. Where’s your mouth? There is a whistle you can buy that makes the sound of a rabbit screaming

Destiny I In far-off England, years ago, There dwelt a wise old sage Who, from the book of future years Could tare for you a page. One day there came into his home A youth of noble birth, Who asked that he'd unfold to him His mission on the earth. "Lord Allsmere," spoke the rev'rend sage, "This day is born for you A wife, in far-off Italy, For whom, one day, you'll sue. Your bride is born of humble birth, No gold or lands has she; But you will love her just the same, However poor she be. "What! — I? How dare you say these things To me, Lord Allsmere's heir!
