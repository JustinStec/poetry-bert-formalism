Quia Amore Langueo IN a valley of this restles mind I sought in mountain and in mead, Trusting a true love for to find. Upon an hill then took I heed; A voice I heard (and near I yede) In great dolour complaining tho: See, dear soul, how my sides bleed Quia amore langueo. Upon this hill I found a tree, Under a tree a man sitting; From head to foot wounded was he; His hearte blood I saw bleeding: A seemly man to be a king, A gracious face to look unto. I asked why he had paining; [He said,] Quia amore langueo. I am true love that false was never; My sister, man's soul, I loved her thus. Because we would in no wise dissever I left my kingdom glorious. I purveyed her a palace full precious; She fled, I followed, I loved her so That I suffered this pain piteous Quia amore langueo. My fair love and my spouse bright! I saved her from beating, and she hath me bet; I clothed her in grace and heavenly light; This bloody shirt she hath on me set; For longing of love yet would I not let; Sweete strokes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Totem All Souls’ over, the roast seeds eaten, I set on a backporch post our sculpted pumpkin under the weather, warm still for November. Night and day it gapes in at us through the kitchen window, going soft in the head. Sleepwalker-slow, a black rash of ants harrows this hollow globe, munching the pale peach flesh, sucking its seasoned last juices dry. In a week, when the ants and humming flies are done, only a hard remorseless light drills and tenants it through and through. Within, it turns mould-black in patches, stays days like this while the weather takes it in its shifty arms: wide eye-spaces shine, the disapproving mouth holds firm. Another week, a sad leap forward: sunk to one side so an eye-socket’s almost blocked, it becomes a monster of its former self. Human, it would have rotted beyond unhappiness and horror to some unspeakable subject state—its nose no more than a vertical hole, the thin bridge of amber between nose and mouth in ruins. The other socket opens wider than ever: disbelief. It’s all downhill from here: knuckles of sun, peremptory steady fingers of frost, strain all day and night— cracking the rind, kneading the knotted fibres
