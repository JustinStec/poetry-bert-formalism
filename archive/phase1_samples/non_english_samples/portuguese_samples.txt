--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hasten, Lord, the glorious time Hasten, Lord, the glorious time When, beneath Messiahâ€™s sway, Every nation, every clime, Shall the Gospel call obey. Mightiest kings His power shall own, Heathen tribes His Name adore; Satan and his host oâ€™erthrown, Bound in chains, shall hurt no more. As when soft and gentle showers Fall upon the thirsty plain, Springing grass and blooming flowers, Clothe the wilderness again; So Thy Spirit shall descend, Softening every stony heart, And its sweetest influence lend, All thatâ€™s lovely to impart. Then shall wars and tumults cease, Then be banished grief and pain, Righteousness and joy and peace, Undisturbed shall ever reign. Bless we, then, our gracious Lord, Ever praise His glorious Name; All His mighty acts record; All His wondrous love proclaim.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
O Soldado Espanhol I O céu era azul, tão meigo e tão brando, E a terra era a noiva que bem se arreava Que a mente exultava, mais longe escutando O mar a quebrar-se na praia arenosa. O céu era azul, e na cor semelhava Vestido sem nódoa de pura donzela; E a terra era a noiva que bem se arreava De flores, matizes; mas vária, mas bela. Ela era brilhante, Qual raio do sol; E ele arrogante, De sangue espanhol. E o espanhol muito amava A virgem mimosa e bela; Ela amante, ele zeloso Dos amores da donzela; Ele tão nobre e folgando De chamar-se escravo dela! E ele disse: — Vês o céu? E ela disse: — Vejo, sim; Mais polido que o polido Do meu véu azul cetim. Torna-lhe ele… (oh! quanto é doce Passar-se uma noite assim!) — Por entre os vidros pintados D’igreja antiga, a luzir Não vês luz? — Vejo. — E não sentes De a veres, meigo sentir? — É doce ver entre as sombras A luz do templo a luzir! — E o mar, além, preguiçoso Não vês tu em calmaria? — É belo o mar; porém sinto, Só de o ver,

Latin Poem II Densantur tenebræ: subsidunt ultima venti Murmura, tranquillumque silet mare: Somnus ab alto Advehitur gelidis, spargitque silentia pennis. Musarum intentus studiis, taciturna per arva Deferor, herbosamque premunt vestigia vallem Somnus babet pecudes: humili de cespite culmen Apparet rarum, et sparsæ per pascua quercus. Fons sacer, irriguos ducens cum murmure flexus, Vicinum reddit fluvio nemus: æquore puro Vibrantes cerno stellas, atque ordine longo Lucida perspicuis simulacra natantia lymphis. Fulgore assiduo et vario convexa colore Ardebant nuper: rapidi violentia cœli Torrebat pecudes, et languida rura premebat. Nunc sedata novos spirat Natura decores, Regalique magis formâ nitet. Æthere toto Se stellæ agglomerant: micat almo lumine campus Cærulus, et densis variantur nubila signis. Sic quondam ruptum subiti miracula mundi Effudit Chaos, et primi exsiluere planetæ Cursibus, atque novum stupuerunt sæcula Solem; Tunc radiis fulsere Arcti, secuitque profundas Orion tenebras: molli et formosior igne Luna per æquoreos radiavit pallida fluctus. Quâcunque aspicio, tremulus per cœrula crescit Ardor, et innumeros stupeo lucescere soles. Talia miranti sacrâ formidine tota Mens rapitur: videor stellantia visere templa Numinis, argenteamque domum, lucisque recessus, Solus ubi in vacuo regnat Pater orbis, et, igne Cinctus inexhausto, devolvit stamina fati, Æquatoque regit varium discrimine mundum. At tu corporeis anima haud retinenda

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
O Amor E O Tempo Pela montanha alcantilada Todos quatro em alegre companhia, O Amor, o Tempo, a minha Amada E eu subiamos um dia. Da minha Amada no gentil semblante Já se viam indicios de cansaço; O Amor passava-nos adeante E o Tempo accelerava o passo. --«Amor! Amor! mais de vagar! Não corras tanto assim, que tão ligeira Não pode com certeza caminhar A minha doce companheira!» Subito, o Amor e o Tempo, combinados, Abrem as asas trémulas ao vento. --«Porque voaes assim tão apressados? Onde vos dirigis? »--Nesse momento, Volta-se o Amor e diz com azedume: --«Tende paciencia, amigos meus! Eu sempre tive este costume De fugir com o Tempo. Adeus! Adeus!»

Verses Addressed To My Two Nephews ON SAINT HELEN'S DAY, 1809. DEAR Boys!--dismiss'd awhile from school, From sober learning's thorny rule,-- The annual race of glory run, The prize bestow'd, the laurels won,-- Ye leave the scientific dome, While noisy rapture hails your home: Home--cherish'd spot! whose magic power Can charm with hope the studious hour; And where the heart--however far-- Points, like the needle to its star! And now, with many a fond oration, Ye ask, to crown this dear vacation, Saturnian time of sport and play, A FÊTE !--to grace SAINT HELEN'S DAY ! But will the Saint propitious see A Fête dear Boys! prepar'd for me? I!--who her altar never sought, An heretic! who idly thought She liv'd alone in pagan fame, And half forgot her sainted name! But--since that name, entwin'd with palms, The legend's deathless page embalms, And since historic truth must own Her crested votary fill'd a throne-- We'll lay our offerings at her shrine, And call her, as she is, divine! Then haste, dear Boys! and deck the bowers, This chosen day, with festive flowers! The votive bouquet joyful bring; And bid your muse, on lofty wing, The steep Parnassian summits climb, And

From Heaven Above to Earth I Come From Heaven above to earth I come, To bear good news to every home; Glad tidings of great joy I bring, Whereof I now will say and sing. To you, this night, is born a Child Of Mary, chosen mother mild; This tender Child of lowly birth, Shall be the joy of all your earth. 'Tis Christ our God, Who far on high Had heard your sad and bitter cry; Himself will your Salvation be, Himself from sin will make you free. He brings those blessings long ago Prepared by God for all below; That in His heavenly kingdom blest You may with us forever rest. These are the tokens ye shall mark, The swaddling clothes and manger dark; There shall ye find the young Child laid, By Whom the heavens and earth were made. Now let us all, with gladsome cheer, Follow the shepherds, and draw near To see this wondrous Gift of God, Who hath His own dear Son bestowed. Give heed, my heart, lift up thine eyes! What is it in yon manger lies? Who is this Child, so young and fair? The blessÃ¨d Christ Child lieth there! Welcome to

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Dilemma Now, by the blessed Paphian queen, Who heaves the breast of sweet sixteen; By every name I cut on bark Before my morning star grew dark; By Hymenâ€™s torch, by Cupidâ€™s dart, By all that thrills the beating heart; The bright black eye, the melting blue,â€”Â­ I cannot choose between the two. I had a vision in my dreams;â€”Â­ I saw a row of twenty beams; From every beam a rope was hung, In every rope a lover swung; I asked the hue of every eye That bade each luckless lover die; Ten shadowy lips said, heavenly blue, And ten accused the darker hue. I asked a matron which she deemed With fairest light of beauty beamed; She answered, some thought both were fair,â€”Â­ Give her blue eyes and golden hair. I might have liked her judgment well, But, as she spoke, she rung the bell, And all her girls, nor small nor few, Came marching in,â€”Â­their eyes were blue. I asked a maiden; back she flung The locks that round her forehead hung, And turned her eye, a glorious one, Bright as a diamond in the sun, On me, until beneath its rays I felt as if

La steaua To the star To the star that rose It's such a long way That it took him thousands of years May the lights reach us. Maybe it died long ago on the way in blue distances, And her ray just now Lights of our sight. The icon of the star that died slowly in the sky it rises; It was when he didn't show up, Today we see it, and it is not. The same way when ours miss Perish in the deep night, The light of extinguished love He's still following us. La steaua care a rãsãrit E-o cale atît de lungã, Cã mii de ani i-au trebuit Luminii sã ne-ajungã. Poate de mult s-a stins în drum în depãrtãri albastre, Iar raza ei abia acum Luci vederii noastre. Icoana stelei ce-a murit încet pe cer se suie; Era pe cînd nu s-a zãrit, Azi o vedem, si nu e. Tot astfel cînd al nostru dor Pieri în noapte-adîncã, Lumina stinsului amor Ne urmãreste încã.

Lembra-me que, em certo dia, Na rua, ao sol de verão, Envenenado morria Um pobre cão. Arfava, espumava e ria, De um riso espúrio e bufão, Ventre e pernas sacudia Na convulsão. Nenhum, nenhum curioso Passava, sem se deter, Silencioso, Junto ao cão que ia morrer, Como se lhe desse gozo Ver padecer.

Song. Written for the dinner given to Charles DICKENS by the young men of Boston, February 1, 1842 The stars their early vigils keep, The silent hours are near, When drooping eyes forget to weep,â€”Â­ Yet still we linger here; And whatâ€”Â­the passing churl may askâ€”Â­ Can claim such wondrous power, That Toil forgets his wonted task, And Love his promised hour? The Irish harp no longer thrills, Or breathes a fainter tone; The clarion blast from Scotlandâ€™s hills, Alas! no more is blown; And Passionâ€™s burning lip bewails Her Haroldâ€™s wasted fire, Still lingering oâ€™er the dust that veils The Lord of Englandâ€™s lyre. But grieve not oâ€™er its broken strings, Nor think its soul hath died, While yet the lark at heavenâ€™s gate sings, As once oâ€™er Avonâ€™s side; While gentle summer sheds her bloom, And dewy blossoms wave, Alike oâ€™er Julietâ€™s storied tomb And Nellyâ€™s nameless grave. Thou glorious island of the sea! Though wide the wasting flood That parts our distant land from thee, We claim thy generous blood; Nor oâ€™er thy far horizon springs One hallowed star of fame, But kindles, like an angelâ€™s wings, Our western skies in flame!

Blijf op het pad volharden, Dat, u ten heil, natuur met rozenbloesems tooit! Smeek groeikracht voor het zaad, zoo kwistig uitgestrooid! En rukk' geen wervelwind de jonge loot aan flarden, Die eens dat zaad ontspruit en 't jeugdig blad ontplooit! Ga, moge u moed noch kracht ontbreken, En wil, met de almacht van de Dichtkunst toegerust, De boezems niet in weelde en dartle drift ontsteken, Maar in 't gewijde vuur van reine hemellust! Wees gij gelukkiger in Vriendschap en in Liefde Dan al te vaak, helaas! de Dichter wezen mag! En blink' de roem, wiens straal nu de uchtendwolkjens kliefde, Eenmaal voor U in vollen dag!

A Rhymed Lesson (Urania) Yes, dear Enchantress,â€”Â­wandering far and long, In realms unperfumed by the breath of song, Where flowers ill-flavored shed their sweets around, And bitterest roots invade the ungenial ground, Whose gems are crystals from the Epsom mine, Whose vineyards flow with antimonial wine, Whose gates admit no mirthful feature in, Save one gaunt mocker, the Sardonic grin, Whose pangs are real, not the woes of rhyme That blue-eyed misses warble out of time;â€”Â­ Truant, not recreant to thy sacred claim, Older by reckoning, but in heart the same, Freed for a moment from the chains of toil, I tread once more thy consecrated soil; Here at thy feet my old allegiance own, Thy subject still, and loyal to thy throne! My dazzled glance explores the crowded hall; Alas, how vain to hope the smiles of all! I know my audience. All the gay and young Love the light antics of a playful tongue; And these, remembering some expansive line My lips let loose among the nuts and wine, Are all impatience till the opening pun Proclaims the witty shamfight is begun. Two fifths at least, if not the total half, Have come infuriate for an earthquake laugh;

Extracts from a Medical Poem. The Stability of Science THE feeble sea-birds, blinded in the storms, On some tall lighthouse dash their little forms, And the rude granite scatters for their pains Those small deposits that were meant for brains. Yet the proud fabric in the morningâ€™s sun Stands all unconscious of the mischief done; Still the red beacon pours its evening rays For the lost pilot with as full a blaze,â€”Â­ Nay, shines, all radiance, oâ€™er the scattered fleet Of gulls and boobies brainless at its feet. I tell their fate, though courtesy disclaims To call our kind by such ungentle names; Yet, if your rashness bid you vainly dare, Think of their doom, ye simple, and beware. See where aloft its hoary forehead rears The towering pride of twice a thousand years! Far, far below the vast incumbent pile Sleeps the gray rock from artâ€™s AEgean isle Its massive courses, circling as they rise, Swell from the waves to mingle with the skies; There every quarry lends its marble spoil, And clustering ages blend their common toil; The Greek, the Roman, reared its ancient walls, The silent Arab arched its mystic halls; In that fair niche, by countless

Carolan's Prophecy A sound of music, from amidst the hills, Came suddenly, and died; a fitful sound Of mirth, soon lost in wail. â€“Again it rose, And sank in mournfulness. â€“There sat a bard, By a blue stream of Erin, where it swept Flashing thro' rock and wood; the sunset's light Was on his wavy, silver-gleaming hair, And the wind's whisper in the mountain-ash, Whose clusters droop'd above. His head was bow'd, His hand was on his harp, yet thence its touch Had drawn but broken strains; and many stood, Waiting around, in silent earnestness, Th' unchaining of his soul, the gush of song,â€“ Many, and graceful forms! yet one alone Seem'd present to his dream; and she indeed, With her pale, virgin brow, and changeful cheek, And the clear starlight of her serious eyes, Lovely amidst the flowing of dark locks And pallid braiding flowers, was beautiful, Ev'n painfully!â€“a creature to behold With trembling midst our joy, lest aught unseen Should waft the vision from us, leaving earth Too dim without its brightness!â€“Did such fear O'ershadow, in that hour, the gifted one, By his own rushing stream? â€“Once more he gaz'd Upon the radiant girl, and yet once more

What a sea it was! how tumid The waters didn't roll! Mountains and plains Everything became sea; And in this dismal scene The screams that sounded It was a unison cry That the earth would end. In vain, O astonished father, At the breast the son straddles; Children, husbands, miserable, In vain you try to escape! May the waters of the flood Grown and remade, They go from the plain to the peaks Up, up, up! Alone, like the single idea Of a world that ends, Erma, floated intrepidly, Noah's Ark; Clean of old stains Of everything that falls apart, Carry it in your breast unharmed Virginity and faith.
