Hark to the pace -horn, chase -horn, race -horn.

And the holy veil of the dawn has gone.

Swiftly the brazen ear comes on.

It burns in the East as the sunrise burns.

I see great flashes where the far trail turns.

Its eyes are lamps like the eyes of dragons.

It drinks gasoline from big red flagons.

Butting through the delicate mists of the morning,
It comes like lightning, goes past roaring.

It will hail all the wind-mills, taunting, ringing,
Dodge the cyclones,
Count the milestones,
On through the ranges the prairie-dog tills—
Scooting past the cattle on the thousand hills.
