They are hunting the goals that they understand:—
San-Francisco and the brown sea-sand.

My goal is the mystery the beggars win.

I am caught in the web the night-winds spin.

The edge of the wheat-ridge speaks to me.

I talk with the leaves of the mulberry tree.

And now I hear, as I sit all alone
In the dusk, by another big Santa-Fe stone,
The souls of the tall corn gathering round
And the gay little souls of the grass in the ground.

Listen to the tale the cotton-wood tells.

Listen to the wind-mills, singing o'er the wells.

Listen to the whistling flutes without price
Of myriad prophets out of paradise.

Harken to the wonder
That the night-air carries.
