- And with a trembling, uncertain hand
Look for the son, groping the darkness
Of your dismal and dreadful night.

Feeling the acrid odor of fresh paint,
A fatal idea came to mind.


His son's icy limbs he gropes,
And the painful softness of the feathers
He knows with a shudder: — run away, come back,
finds the hard skull under his hands,
Stripped then of the natural ornament!.
