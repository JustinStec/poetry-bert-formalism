- And then?

-Here I am.

—Does this tab stay?

— In the direction of the sun, when it transmounts.

- Far away?

- Not a lot.

— You're right: let's go.

— And do you want to go?

“For the love of a sad old man,
That the fatal term has arrived,
You warriors grant
Life to a prisoner.

Such a noble deed honors you,
not so high courtesy
I saw never practiced
Among the Tupis — and but they were
Gentlemen in kindness.

“But I never conquered,
Not even gun fights
Nor for nobility in acts;
Here I come, and the son I bring.

You say prisoner,
Be as you say;
Sends! come the wood, the fire,
the apple of sacrifice
And the light muçurana:
In all the rite is fulfilled!
And when I'm alone on earth,
Certainly I will find among yours,
How kindly they reveal themselves,
Someone my steps guide;
Someone who sees my chest
covered in scars,
Taking my son's turn,
To have me as a father, boast!"
But the chief of the Timbiras,
The brows creasing,
To the old Tupi warrior
Responds with a dark accent:
"I will do nothing of what you say:
It is your imbecile and weak son!
would demean the triumph
From the most warlike of tribes
Spill your ignoble blood:
He wept like a coward;
We others, strong Timbiras,
We only make pasture of heroes.
