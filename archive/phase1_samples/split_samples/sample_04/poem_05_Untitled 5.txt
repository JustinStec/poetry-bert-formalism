Retreats afflicted and fearful, covering
To the hands both fulminating eyes,
How is the sad old man still afraid
To see, not more cruel, but clearer,
From that great exercise the living image
Before the eyes of the figured body.

It wasn't that the truth knew
Whole and as cruel as it had been;
But what bad luck had the son run into,
He saw him; he had him there present;
And it was to be repeated every moment.

The past pain, the future prediction
And the present so black, there it was;
There in the heart was concentrated,
It was only one point, but it was death!
— You prisoner, you?

— You said so.

"From the Indians?

- Yea.

"From what nation?

— Timbiras
— And you broke the funeral wall,
Of the false manitots you broke the apple.
