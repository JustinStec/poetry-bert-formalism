I-Juca Pirama

I-Juca Pirama
I
In the midst of tabas of pleasant greenery,
Surrounded by logs—covered with flowers,
The roofs of a proud nation are raised;
There are many of your children, in strong spirits,
Fearsome in war, who in dense cohorts
They haunt the immense expanse of woods.

They are loud, severe, thirsty for glory,
Already prelios incite, already sing victory,
Now the sweet ones respond to the singer's voice:
They are all Timbiras, brave warriors!
Your name flies in people's mouths,
Condon of prodigies, of glory and terror!
The neighboring tribes, without strength, without pride,
The weapons breaking, throwing them into the river,
The incense they aspired from their maracas:
Fearful of the wars that the strong light,
Expensive ignominious tributes they yield there,
To the tough warriors subject to peace.

In the center of the taba extends a yard,
Where now the warrior council gathers
Of the lady tribe, of the servile tribes:
The old men sitting down practiced from the past,
And the restless young men, whom the party enamors,
They spill out around an unhappy Indian.

Who is it?

— no one knows: his name is unknown,
Your tribe does not say: — of a remote people
Descends indeed—from a gentle people;
So there in Greece to the island slave
Made them distinct from the vile Muslim
The correct lines of the noble profile.

By cases of war fell prisoner
In the hands of the Timbiras: — in the extensive terreiro
The ceiling that held him in prison is devastated;
The surrounding tribes are invited,
Careful they take care of the vase of colors,
Of the various accompaniments of the honorable function.

The wood of the vast fire is gathered,
The light embira rope is tightened,
The mace is adorned with gentle feathers:
At cost, among the vacancies of the village people
Walks the Timbira, which the mob surrounds,
Dashing in feathers of various shades.

However, women with leda triganza,
Accustomed to the rite of barbaric usança,
The Indian already wants captive to end:
The coma cuts him, the limbs dye him,
Shining enduape on the body encircle him,
Shades his forehead gentle singing.

II
In deep vases of white clay boil the cauim;
Cups are filled, pleasure begins, feasting reigns.

The prisoner, whose death they long for, sits,
The prisoner, what other setting sun will ever see!
The hard rope, which encircles her lap, shows her the end
From the dark life, which will be shorter than the feast!
Yet the eyes of ignoble weeping are dry;
Mute lips do not descend complaints from the heart.

But a martyrdom, which cannot be covered up, makes wrinkles
The lying placidity of the face on the bold forehead!
What do you have, warrior?

What fear assails you in the horrendous step?

Honor of the tabas that born saw you, day off dying.

Slack dying; because beyond the Andes revives the fort,
Who knew how to proudly contrast the fears of cold death.

Creeping grass, exposed to the sun, to the rain, there withers and hangs:
Only to the trunk, which devastates the air, does lightning offend!
What is it?

Tupã ordered him to fall, as he lived;
And the hunter who saw him prostrated fainted!
What are you afraid of, O warrior?

Beyond the Andes revives the fort,
Who knew how to proudly contrast the fears of cold death.

III
In a wide circle of new warriors
Ledo walks the Timbira festival,
To whom the sacrifice belongs the honors.

On the forehead the canitar shakes in waves,
The enduape on the strap sways,
In the right hand I weigh the ivirapeme,
Proud and vigorous.

— at the smallest step
Ivory target necklace, badge of honor,
That adorns her neck and chest, roars and trembles,
As if by an unknown spell
Enchanted there the great souls
Of the vanquished Tapuias, still cry
Being glory and coat of arms of fierce enemies.

“Here I am, says the prisoner Indian;
“Since I am weak, and without tribe, and without family,
“Our forests you dared devastated,
“You will die a vile death at the hand of a strong one.

The miserable opposite comes to terreiro;
From the lap to the belt the muçurana descends:
“Tell us who you are, sing your deeds,
“Or if it pleases you more, defend yourself.

” Begins
The Indian, who pours out his eyes around,
With sad voice that the mood moves.

IV
My death song,
Warriors, hear:
I am a child of the wilds,
In the wilds I grew up;
warriors coming down
From the Tupi tribe.

Of the puissant tribe,
who is wandering now
By fickle fate,
Warriors, I was born;
I'm brave, I'm strong,
I am a son of the North;
My death song,
Warriors, I heard.

I've seen raw fights,
From enemy tribes,
And the hard fatigues
I tasted of war;
in mendacious waves
I felt for the faces
the fleeting hisses
Of the winds I loved.

I walked far lands,
I fought cruel wars,
I wandered through the mountains
Of the vile Aimorés;
I saw brave fights,
I saw forts—slaves!
of gnawing strangers
Footwear.

And the ploughed fields,
And the broken bows,
And the poor piagas
No longer maracas;
And the sweet singers,
Serving the lords,
That traitors came,
With signs of peace
To the blows of the enemy
My last friend,
homeless, homeless
Fell next to me!
With placid face,
Serene and composed,
the bitter disgust
With me I suffered.

My father by my side
Already blind and broken,
grated feathers,
Signed in me:
We both, petty,
By wayward paths,
covered with thorns
We got here!
The old however
suffering already so much
Of hunger and brokenness,
I just wanted to die!
I hold back no more,
I wander into the woods,
Of the arrows I have
I want to be worth it.

So, outsider,
I fell prisoner
From a warrior section
How I found myself:
the raw restlessness
Of the weak and blind father,
Until I arrive,
Whatever — say it!
I was your guide
In the dark night,
the only joy
What God has left you
He leaned on me,
In me it was signed,
Rested in me,
What a son I am to you.

To the poor old man
grated feathers,
Already blind and broken,
What's left?

- To die.

while describing
The turn so short
Of the life you had,
Let me live!
Not vile, not ignite,
But strong, but brave,
I will be your slave:
Here I will come.

Warriors, not chorus
From the tears that I cry;
If I deplore life,
I also know how to die.

V
Release him! says the boss.

Astonishes the mob;
The warriors murmur: barely heard,
Nor can a chief ever give such an order!
Shouts a second time with a louder voice,
Prisons are loosened, the embira gives way,
At cost, yes; but gives in: the stranger is saved,
— Timbira, says the tender Indian,
Released only from the knots that held him:
You are an illustrious warrior, a great leader,
You who were so moved by my evil,
Nor do you suffer that, transposing nature,
With eyes where the light no longer flickers,
The tired father mourns the death of the son,
That only by his in the voice he knows.

— You are free; part.

"And I will.

— In vain.

— Yes, I will return, my father dead.

"Don't come back!"
It's very happy, if it exists, in which you don't see it,
What son has, what cries: you are free; part!
"Do you think I'm chickening out,
How afraid I am to die!
— You are free; part!
— Well, I won't go; I want to prove to you
That a son of the Tupi lives with honor,
And with greater honor, if by chance they win,
From death the glorious step affront.

— You lied, that a Tupi never cries,
And you cried!… part; We do not want
With vile flesh weaken the strong.

The Tupi survived: - heaving in waves
The beating of the heart was heard
Rush.

- Of the flushed face
Cold beads of sweat ran:
Perhaps a thought assailed him.


Not anymore.


that in the mourning fantasy,
A grief, a martyrdom at the same time,
From old father to dying image
Almost screaming heard him: - Ungrateful! ungrateful!
Curved lap, sullen and cold,
Specter of man, penetrated the forest!
SAW
— My son, where are you?

— Beside you;
Here I bring you provisions: take them,
Your strength restore lost,
And on the way, and now!
"You took too long!"
Wasn't the sun born when you left,
And loose your heat I already feel it now!
— Yes, I took my time wandering aimlessly,
I got lost in these intricate woods,
I revived and returned; but time is pressing;
It's best to leave, and now!
— What new evils
Are we left to suffer?

— what new pains,
In the other worse fado, does Tupã guard us?

— The arrows of affliction have run out,
Not even for a new blow, intact space
In our bodies it remains.

- But you tremble
"Perhaps from the eagerness of hunting.


— oh dear son
Something mysterious here tells me,
Here in the heart; pious fraud
It will be for sure, that you never lie!
You don't know fear, and now you fear?

I see and I know: it is Tupã that afflicts us,
And against your will, they are not worth pride.

Let's go!.


- And with a trembling, uncertain hand
Look for the son, groping the darkness
Of your dismal and dreadful night.

Feeling the acrid odor of fresh paint,
A fatal idea came to mind.


His son's icy limbs he gropes,
And the painful softness of the feathers
He knows with a shudder: — run away, come back,
finds the hard skull under his hands,
Stripped then of the natural ornament!.


Retreats afflicted and fearful, covering
To the hands both fulminating eyes,
How is the sad old man still afraid
To see, not more cruel, but clearer,
From that great exercise the living image
Before the eyes of the figured body.

It wasn't that the truth knew
Whole and as cruel as it had been;
But what bad luck had the son run into,
He saw him; he had him there present;
And it was to be repeated every moment.

The past pain, the future prediction
And the present so black, there it was;
There in the heart was concentrated,
It was only one point, but it was death!
— You prisoner, you?

— You said so.

"From the Indians?

- Yea.

"From what nation?

— Timbiras
— And you broke the funeral wall,
Of the false manitots you broke the apple.


— I did nothing… here I am.

- Anything! ?


They become silent;
Shortly after, the old man continues:
— You are brave, I know it well; I confess,
You did it, right, or you were no longer alive!
— I did nothing; but they knew of the existence
From a poor old man, who only lived in me.


- And then?

-Here I am.

—Does this tab stay?

— In the direction of the sun, when it transmounts.

- Far away?

- Not a lot.

— You're right: let's go.

— And do you want to go?

“Towards sunset.

VII
“For the love of a sad old man,
That the fatal term has arrived,
You warriors grant
Life to a prisoner.

Such a noble deed honors you,
not so high courtesy
I saw never practiced
Among the Tupis — and but they were
Gentlemen in kindness.

“But I never conquered,
Not even gun fights
Nor for nobility in acts;
Here I come, and the son I bring.

You say prisoner,
Be as you say;
Sends! come the wood, the fire,
the apple of sacrifice
And the light muçurana:
In all the rite is fulfilled!
And when I'm alone on earth,
Certainly I will find among yours,
How kindly they reveal themselves,
Someone my steps guide;
Someone who sees my chest
covered in scars,
Taking my son's turn,
To have me as a father, boast!"
But the chief of the Timbiras,
The brows creasing,
To the old Tupi warrior
Responds with a dark accent:
"I will do nothing of what you say:
It is your imbecile and weak son!
would demean the triumph
From the most warlike of tribes
Spill your ignoble blood:
He wept like a coward;
We others, strong Timbiras,
We only make pasture of heroes.


From the old Tupi warrior
The deaf voice in the throat
It makes confusing sounds,
Like the roars of a tiger,
That little by little it gets scared!
VIII
“Did you weep in the presence of death?

In the presence of strangers did you cry?

The coward does not descend from the strong;
Because you cried, my son you are not!
May you, accursed descendant
From a tribe of noble warriors,
Begging cruel outsiders,
Being prey to vile Aimorés.

“May you, isolated on earth,
Without support and without homeland wandering,
Rejected from death in war,
Rejected from men in peace,
To be the execrated specter of the people;
Don't find love in women,
Your friends, if you have friends,
Have a fickle and deceitful soul!
“Find no sweetness in the day,
Not even the colors of the dawn love you,
And among the larvae of the dark night
You can never rest enjoy:
Don't find a log, a stone,
Out in the sun, out in the rain and wind,
Suffering the greatest torments,
Where can your forehead land.

“May the grass grow at your feet;
Meadows wither, the flower fades,
And the stream that runs clear,
But the vesano fury ignites you;
Its waters quickly become,
To the contact of thirsty lips,
Impure lake of disgusting worms,
Whence festivities like disgust and terror!
“Ever the sky, like a burning ceiling,
Grow and punish your cursed limbs
And the ocean of blackened dust
Be the earth to the tupi ignavo!
Miserable, hungry, thirsty,
Manitôs do not speak to you in dreams,
And from horror the ghastly specters
Always bring the coward after you.

“A friend, don't be merciful
May your body on earth embalm me,
I put it in a careful clay pot
Bow and arrow and club at your feet!
Be cursed, and alone on earth;
For you have come to such vileness,
That in the presence of death you cried,
You, coward, my son are not.

IX
This saying, the old meserand
To whom does Tupã feel such pain, such fado?

Already at the ends of life I had reserved,
Go with trembling feet, with already cold hands
From your dark night to the dense darkness
Palpating.

- Alarm! alarm! - The old man stops.

The cry he heard is the son's voice,
Voice of war that you have heard so many times
On another, better block.

- Alarm! alarm!
— That moment is only worth erasing.

The long trances, the anguish,
That the cold heart tormented you
From a warrior and a father: - it's worth it, and more.

He who in so much pain had restrained himself,
Taken by the sudden contrast,
Dissolve now in copious tears,
May the weary heart rejuvenate.

The taba rumbles, the blows descend,
Screams, deep imprecations sound,
Tangled the raging crowd,
It revolves, it tangles confusedly,
And more revolt in mor fury is kindled.

And the sounds of blows that incessantly boil.

Voices, groans, death rattles
Go far through the mountain ranges
Of the human storm propagating
How many waves of angry people
Against a living rock they broke.

It was him, Tupi; it wasn't even fair
May the fame of the Tupi - the name, the glory,
Endured labor of so many years,
Last coat of arms of the extinct race,
In one jet and by one it would annihilate.

- Enough! cries the chief of the Timbiras,
"Enough, illustrious warrior!" you fought enough,
And for sacrifice you need strength.


The warrior stopped, fell into the arms
Of the old father, who girded him to his bosom,
With tears of joy shouting:
“This, indeed, is my beloved son!
“And since I finally find him, as I always had him,
“The tears I cry run free,
“These tears, yes, which do not dishonor.

X
An old Timbira, covered in glory,
kept the memory
From the young warrior, from the old Tupi!
And at night, in the tabas, if anyone doubted
what he told
He said prudently: - “Boys, I saw it!
“I saw the brave man in the wide yard
sing prisoner
His death song, which I never forgot:
Brave as he was, he wept without shame;
I seem to see you
That I have it right now in front of me.

“I said to myself: What infamy of a slave!
No, he was a brave man;
Brave and bold, like him, I didn't see!
And to the faith that I say to you: it seems to me charming
That who cried so much,
If only he had the courage that Tupi had!”
Thus Timbira, covered in glory,
kept the memory
Of the young warrior, of the old Tupi.

And at night in tabas, if anyone doubted
what he told
He took it prudently: “Boys, I saw it!”
I
No meio das tabas de amenos verdores,
Cercadas de troncos — cobertos de flores,
Alteiam-se os tetos d’altiva nação;
São muitos seus filhos, nos ânimos fortes,
Temíveis na guerra, que em densas coortes
Assombram das matas a imensa extensão.

São rudos, severos, sedentos de glória,
Já prélios incitam, já cantam vitória,
Já meigos atendem à voz do cantor:
São todos Timbiras, guerreiros valentes!
Seu nome lá voa na boca das gentes,
Condão de prodígios, de glória e terror!
As tribos vizinhas, sem forças, sem brio,
As armas quebrando, lançando-as ao rio,
O incenso aspiraram dos seus maracás:
Medrosos das guerras que os fortes acendem,
Custosos tributos ignavos lá rendem,
Aos duros guerreiros sujeitos na paz.

No centro da taba se estende um terreiro,
Onde ora se aduna o concílio guerreiro
Da tribo senhora, das tribos servis:
Os velhos sentados praticam d’outrora,
E os moços inquietos, que a festa enamora,
Derramam-se em torno dum índio infeliz.

Quem é?

— ninguém sabe: seu nome é ignoto,
Sua tribo não diz: — de um povo remoto
Descende por certo — dum povo gentil;
Assim lá na Grécia ao escravo insulano
Tornavam distinto do vil muçulmano
As linhas corretas do nobre perfil.

Por casos de guerra caiu prisioneiro
Nas mãos dos Timbiras: — no extenso terreiro
Assola-se o teto, que o teve em prisão;
Convidam-se as tribos dos seus arredores,
Cuidosos se incumbem do vaso das cores,
Dos vários aprestos da honrosa função.

Acerva-se a lenha da vasta fogueira,
Entesa-se a corda de embira ligeira,
Adorna-se a maça com penas gentis:
A custo, entre as vagas do povo da aldeia
Caminha o Timbira, que a turba rodeia,
Garboso nas plumas de vário matiz.

Entanto as mulheres com leda trigança,
Afeitas ao rito da bárbara usança,
O índio já querem cativo acabar:
A coma lhe cortam, os membros lhe tingem,
Brilhante enduape no corpo lhe cingem,
Sombreia-lhe a fronte gentil canitar.

II
Em fundos vasos d’alvacenta argila ferve o cauim;
Enchem-se as copas, o prazer começa, reina o festim.

O prisioneiro, cuja morte anseiam, sentado está,
O prisioneiro, que outro sol no ocaso jamais verá!
A dura corda, que lhe enlaça o colo, mostra-lhe o fim
Da vida escura, que será mais breve do que o festim!
Contudo os olhos d’ignóbil pranto secos estão;
Mudos os lábios não descerram queixas do coração.

Mas um martírio, que encobrir não pode, em rugas faz
A mentirosa placidez do rosto na fronte audaz!
Que tens, guerreiro?

Que temor te assalta no passo horrendo?

Honra das tabas que nascer te viram, folga morrendo.

Folga morrendo; porque além dos Andes revive o forte,
Que soube ufano contrastar os medos da fria morte.

Rasteira grama, exposta ao sol, à chuva, lá murcha e pende:
Somente ao tronco, que devassa os ares, o raio ofende!
Que foi?

Tupã mandou que ele caísse, como viveu;
E o caçador que o avistou prostrado esmoreceu!
Que temes, ó guerreiro?

Além dos Andes revive o forte,
Que soube ufano contrastar os medos da fria morte.

III
Em larga roda de novéis guerreiros
Ledo caminha o festival Timbira,
A quem do sacrifício cabe as honras.

Na fronte o canitar sacode em ondas,
O enduape na cinta se embalança,
Na destra mão sopesa a ivirapeme,
Orgulhoso e pujante.

— Ao menor passo
Colar d’alvo marfim, insígnia d’honra,
Que lhe orna o colo e o peito, ruge e freme,
Como que por feitiço não sabido
Encantadas ali as almas grandes
Dos vencidos Tapuias, inda chorem
Serem glória e brasão d'imigos feros.

“Eis-me aqui, diz ao índio prisioneiro;
“Pois que fraco, e sem tribo, e sem família,
“As nossas matas devassaste ousado,
“Morrerás morte vil da mão de um forte.

Vem a terreiro o mísero contrário;
Do colo à cinta a muçurana desce:
“Dize-nos quem és, teus feitos canta,
“Ou se mais te apraz, defende-te.

” Começa
O índio, que ao redor derrama os olhos,
Com triste voz que os ânimos comove.

IV
Meu canto de morte,
Guerreiros, ouvi:
Sou filho das selvas,
Nas selvas cresci;
Guerreiros, descendo
Da tribo Tupi.

Da tribo pujante,
Que agora anda errante
Por fado inconstante,
Guerreiros, nasci;
Sou bravo, sou forte,
Sou filho do Norte;
Meu canto de morte,
Guerreiros, ouvi.

Já vi cruas brigas,
De tribos imigas,
E as duras fadigas
Da guerra provei;
Nas ondas mendaces
Senti pelas faces
Os silvos fugaces
Dos ventos que amei.

Andei longes terras,
Lidei cruas guerras,
Vaguei pelas serras
Dos vis Aimorés;
Vi lutas de bravos,
Vi fortes — escravos!
De estranhos ignavos
Calcados aos pés.

E os campos talados,
E os arcos quebrados,
E os piagas coitados
Já sem maracás;
E os meigos cantores,
Servindo a senhores,
Que vinham traidores,
Com mostras de paz
Aos golpes do imigo
Meu último amigo,
Sem lar, sem abrigo
Caiu junto a mi!
Com plácido rosto,
Sereno e composto,
O acerbo desgosto
Comigo sofri.

Meu pai a meu lado
Já cego e quebrado,
De penas ralado,
Firmava-se em mi:
Nós ambos, mesquinhos,
Por ínvios caminhos,
Cobertos d’espinhos
Chegamos aqui!
O velho no entanto
Sofrendo já tanto
De fome e quebranto,
Só qu’ria morrer!
Não mais me contenho,
Nas matas me embrenho,
Das frechas que tenho
Me quero valer.

Então, forasteiro,
Caí prisioneiro
De um troço guerreiro
Com que me encontrei:
O cru dessossego
Do pai fraco e cego,
Enquanto não chego,
Qual seja — dizei!
Eu era o seu guia
Na noite sombria,
A só alegria
Que Deus lhe deixou:
Em mim se apoiava,
Em mim se firmava,
Em mim descansava,
Que filho lhe sou.

Ao velho coitado
De penas ralado,
Já cego e quebrado,
Que resta?

- Morrer.

Enquanto descreve
O giro tão breve
Da vida que teve,
Deixa-me viver!
Não vil, não ignavo,
Mas forte, mas bravo,
Serei vosso escravo:
Aqui virei ter.

Guerreiros, não coro
Do pranto que choro;
Se a vida deploro,
Também sei morrer.

V
Soltai-o! — diz o chefe.

Pasma a turba;
Os guerreiros murmuram: mal ouviram,
Nem pode nunca um chefe dar tal ordem!
Brada segunda vez com voz mais alta,
Afrouxam-se as prisões, a embira cede,
A custo, sim; mas cede: o estranho é salvo,
— Timbira, diz o índio enternecido,
Solto apenas dos nós que o seguravam:
És um guerreiro ilustre, um grande chefe,
Tu que assim do meu mal te comoveste,
Nem sofres que, transposta a natureza,
Com olhos onde a luz já não cintila,
Chore a morte do filho o pai cansado,
Que somente por seu na voz conhece.

— És livre; parte.

— E voltarei.

— Debalde.

— Sim, voltarei, morto meu pai.

— Não voltes!
É bem feliz, se existe, em que não veja,
Que filho tem, qual chora: és livre; parte!
— Acaso tu supões que me acobardo,
Que receio morrer!
— És livre; parte!
— Ora não partirei; quero provar-te
Que um filho dos Tupis vive com honra,
E com honra maior, se acaso vencem,
Da morte o passo glorioso afronta.

— Mentiste, que um Tupi não chora nunca,
E tu choraste!… parte; não queremos
Com carne vil enfraquecer os fortes.

Sobresteve o Tupi: - arfando em ondas
O rebater do coração se ouvia
Precipite.

- Do rosto afogueado
Gélidas bagas de suor corriam:
Talvez que o assaltava um pensamento…
Já não… que na enlutada fantasia,
Um pesar, um martírio ao mesmo tempo,
Do velho pai a moribunda imagem
Quase bradar-lhe ouvia: - Ingrato! ingrato!
Curvado o colo, taciturno e frio,
Espectro d’homem, penetrou no bosque!
VI
— Filho meu, onde estás?

— Ao vosso lado;
Aqui vos trago provisões: tomai-as,
As vossas forças restaurar perdidas,
E a caminho, e já!
— Tardaste muito!
Não era nado o sol, quando partiste,
E frouxo o seu calor já sinto agora!
— Sim, demorei-me a divagar sem rumo,
Perdi-me nestas matas intrincadas,
Reaviei-me e tornei; mas urge o tempo;
Convém partir, e já!
— Que novos males
Nos resta de sofrer?

— que novas dores,
No outro fado pior Tupã nos guarda?

— As setas da aflição já se esgotaram,
Nem para novo golpe espaço intacto
Em nossos corpos resta.

— Mas tu tremes
— Talvez do afã da caça…
— Oh filho caro
Um quê misterioso aqui me fala,
Aqui no coração; piedosa fraude
Será por certo, que não mentes nunca!
Não conheces temor, e agora temes?

Vejo e sei: é Tupã que nos aflige,
E contra o seu querer não valem brios.

Partamos!… — E com mão trêmula, incerta
Procura o filho, tateando as trevas
Da sua noite lúgubre e medonha.

Sentindo o acre odor das frescas tintas,
Uma idéia fatal correu-lhe à mente…
Do filho os membros gélidos apalpa,
E a dolorosa maciez das plumas
Conhece estremecendo: — foge, volta,
encontra sob as mãos o duro crânio,
Despido então do natural ornato!…
Recua aflito e pávido, cobrindo
Às mãos ambas os olhos fulminados,
Como que teme ainda o triste velho
De ver, não mais cruel, porém mais clara,
Daquele exício grande a imagem viva
Ante os olhos do corpo afigurada.

Não era que a verdade conhecesse
Inteira e tão cruel qual tinha sido;
Mas que funesto azar correra o filho,
Ele o via; ele o tinha ali presente;
E era de repetir-se a cada instante.

A dor passada, a previsão futura
E o presente tão negro, ali os tinha;
Ali no coração se concentrava,
Era num ponto só, mas era a morte!
— Tu prisioneiro, tu?

— Vós o dissesses.

— Dos índios?

— Sim.

— De que nação?

— Timbiras
— E a muçurana funeral rompeste,
Dos falsos manitôs quebraste a maça…
— Nada fiz… aqui estou.

— Nada! —
Emudecem;
Curto instante depois prossegue o velho:
— Tu és valente, bem o sei; confesso,
Fizeste-o, certo, ou já não foras vivo!
— Nada fiz; mas souberam da existência
De um pobre velho, que em mim só vivia…
— E depois?

—Eis-me aqui.

—Fica essa taba?

— Na direção do sol, quando transmonta.

— Longe?

— Não muito.

— Tens razão: partamos.

— E quereis ir?

— Na direção do ocaso.

VII
“Por amor de um triste velho,
Que ao termo fatal já chega,
Vós, guerreiros, concedesses
A vida a um prisioneiro.

Ação tão nobre vos honra,
Nem tão alta cortesia
Vi eu jamais praticada
Entre os Tupis — e mas foram
Senhores em gentileza.

“Eu porém nunca vencido,
Nem os combates por armas
Nem por nobreza nos atos;
Aqui venho, e o filho trago.

Vós o dizeis prisioneiro,
Seja assim como dizeis;
Manda! vir a lenha, o fogo,
A maça do sacrifício
E a muçurana ligeira:
Em tudo o rito se cumpra!
E quando eu for só na terra,
Certo acharei entre os vossos,
Que tão gentis se revelam,
Alguém que meus passos guie;
Alguém, que vendo o meu peito
Coberto de cicatrizes,
Tomando a vez de meu filho,
De haver-me por pai se ufane!"
Mas o chefe dos Timbiras,
Os sobrolhos encrespando,
Ao velho Tupi guerreiro
Responde com torvo acento:
— Nada farei do que dizes:
É teu filho imbele e fraco!
Aviltaria o triunfo
Da mais guerreira das tribos
Derramar seu ignóbil sangue:
Ele chorou de cobarde;
Nós outros, fortes Timbiras,
Só de heróis fazemos pasto.

Do velho Tupi guerreiro
A surda voz na garganta
Faz ouvir uns sons confusos,
Como os rugidos de um tigre,
Que pouco a pouco se assanha!

“Tu choraste em presença da morte?

Na presença de estranhos choraste?

Não descende o cobarde do forte;
Pois choraste, meu filho não és!
Possas tu, descendente maldito
De uma tribo de nobres guerreiros,
Implorando cruéis forasteiros,
Seres presa de vis Aimorés.

“Possas tu, isolado na terra,
Sem arrimo e sem pátria vagando,
Rejeitado da morte na guerra,
Rejeitado dos homens na paz,
Ser das gentes o espectro execrado;
Não encontres amor nas mulheres,
Teus amigos, se amigos tiveres,
Tenham alma inconstante e falaz!
“Não encontres doçura no dia,
Nem as cores da aurora te ameiguem,
E entre as larvas da noite sombria
Nunca possas descanso gozar:
Não encontres um tronco, uma pedra,
Posta ao sol, posta às chuvas e aos ventos,
Padecendo os maiores tormentos,
Onde possas a fronte pousar.

“Que a teus passos a relva se torre;
Murchem prados, a flor desfaleça,
E o regato que límpido corre,
Mais te acenda o vesano furor;
Suas águas depressa se tornem,
Ao contacto dos lábios sedentos,
Lago impuro de vermes nojentos,
Donde festas como asco e terror!
“Sempre o céu, como um teto incendido,
Creste e punja teus membros malditos
E o oceano de pó denegrido
Seja a terra ao ignavo tupi!
Miserável, faminto, sedento,
Manitôs lhe não falem nos sonhos,
E do horror os espectros medonhos
Traga sempre o cobarde após si.

“Um amigo não tenhas piedoso
Que o teu corpo na terra embalsame,
Pondo em vaso d’argila cuidoso
Arco e frecha e tacape a teus pés!
Sé maldito, e sozinho na terra;
Pois que a tanta vileza chegaste,
Que em presença da morte choraste,
Tu, cobarde, meu filho não és.

IX
Isto dizendo, o meserando velho
A quem Tupã tamanha dor, tal fado
Já nos confins da vida reservara,
Vai com trêmulo pé, com as mãos já frias
Da sua noite escura as densas trevas
Palpando.

- Alarma! alarma! - O velho para.

O grito que escutou é voz do filho,
Voz de guerra que ouviu já tantas vezes
Noutra quadra melhor.

- Alarma! alarma!
— Esse momento só vale apagar-lhe
Os tão compridos transes, as angústias,
Que o frio coração lhe atormentaram
De guerreiro e de pai: - vale, e de sobra.

Ele que em tanta dor se contivera,
Tomado pelo súbito contraste,
Desfaz-se agora em pranto copioso,
Que o exaurido coração remoça.

A taba se alborota, os golpes descem,
Gritos, imprecações profundas soam,
Emaranhada a multidão braveja,
Revolve-se, enovela-se confusa,
E mais revolta em mor furor se acende.

E os sons dos golpes que incessantes fervem.

Vozes, gemidos, estertor de morte
Vão longe pelas ermas serranias
Da humana tempestade propagando
Quantas vagas de povo enfurecido
Contra um rochedo vivo se quebravam.

Era ele, o Tupi; nem fora justo
Que a fama dos Tupis - o nome, a glória,
Aturado labor de tantos anos,
Derradeiro brasão da raça extinta,
De um jacto e por um só se aniquilasse.

— Basta! clama o chefe dos Timbiras,
— Basta, guerreiro ilustre! assaz lutaste,
E para o sacrifício é mister forças.

O guerreiro parou, caiu nos braços
Do velho pai, que o cinge contra o peito,
Com lágrimas de júbilo bradando:
“Este, sim, que é meu filho muito amado!
“E pois que o acho enfim, qual sempre o tive,
“Corram livres as lágrimas que choro,
“Estas lágrimas, sim, que não desonram.

Um velho Timbira, coberto de glória,
guardou a memória
Do moço guerreiro, do velho Tupi!
E à noite, nas tabas, se alguém duvidava
do que ele contava,
Dizia prudente: - “Meninos, eu vi!
“Eu vi o brioso no largo terreiro
cantar prisioneiro
Seu canto de morte, que nunca esqueci:
Valente, como era, chorou sem ter pejo;
parece que o vejo,
Que o tenho nest’hora diante de mim.

“Eu disse comigo: Que infâmia d’escravo!
Pois não, era um bravo;
Valente e brioso, como ele, não vi!
E à fé que vos digo: parece-me encanto
Que quem chorou tanto,
Tivesse a coragem que tinha o Tupi!”
Assim o Timbira, coberto de glória,
guardava a memória
Do moço guerreiro, do velho Tupi.

E à noite nas tabas, se alguém duvidava
do que ele contava,
Tomava prudente: “Meninos, eu vi!”
