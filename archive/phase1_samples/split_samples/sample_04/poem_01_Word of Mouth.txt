After a Nick Cave “Soundsuit” made from buttons and found vintage abacus


When George Washington became president in

1789 he had only one tooth in his head, a single

premolar poking up from his gums.

His dent-

ures were fashioned from lead, gold wire springs,

brass screws, the teeth of humans and cows, ele-

phant ivory, and hippopotamus bone.

It is a myth

that he had false teeth made of wood.

A mis-

perception put forth by those misled by the hair-

line fractures that ivory and bone possess.

Just as

cherry wine will stain cloth with a rust-hued vein,

Washington’s fondness for dark wine blemished

his teeth.

The fractures eventually darkening, un-

til resembling the grain in a piece of wood.

The darkening of fractures is rather curious.

The makeup of the flesh, the constitution of

origin, the trackers of bloodlines thrown off

the trail.

It is difficult to determine what discolor-

ations have tunneled their way through the body.

Spider veins climbing the back of my legs like a

winding river mapping the trauma.

An unspoken

collective of ephemeral bits and bytes, suffering

most eloquently preserved in the mouth.

The skin

of one’s teeth decides many a fate.

A black woman’s

incisor settling down inside a white man’s maw.

Overall, a quizzical look, an off-color joke about

progress, the very blood a trick of the eye, an ocean

blue on the outside of the skin, a blushing

red if viewed just beneath the sheath.
