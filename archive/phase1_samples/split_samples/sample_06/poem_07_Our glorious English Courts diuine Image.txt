As it should be in this our golden age.

127
Away Terpsichore, light Muse away,
And come Vrania, Prophetesse diuine;
Come Muse of heau'n, my burning thirst allay,
Euen now, for want of sacred drinke I tine.

In heau'nly moysture dip thys Pen of mine,
And let my mouth with Nectar ouerflow,
For I must more then mortall glory show.

128
O that I had Homers aboundant vaine,
I would heereof another Ilias make,
Or els the man of Mantuas charmed braine
In whose large throat great Ioue the thunder spake.

O that I could old Gefferies Muse awake,
Or borrow Colins fayre heroike stile,
Or smooth my rimes with Delias seruants file.

129
O could I sweet Companion, sing like you,
VVhich of a shadow, vnder a shadow sing;
Or like faire Salues sad louer true,
Or like the Bay, the Marigolds darling,
Whose suddaine verse Loue couers with his wing:
O that your braines were mingled all with mine,
T'inlarge my wit for this great worke diuine.

130
Yet Astrophell might one for all suffize,
VVhose supple Muse Camelion-like doth change
Into all formes of excellent deuise:
So might the Swallow, whose swift Muse doth range
Through rare Ideas, and inuentions strange,
And euer doth enioy her ioyfull spring,
And sweeter then the Nightingale doth sing.

131
O that I might that singing Swallow heare
To whom I owe my seruice and my loue,
His sugred tunes would so enchant mine eare,
And in my mind such sacred fury moue,
As I should knock at heau'ns great gate aboue
With my proude rimes, while of this heau'nly state
I doe aspire the shadows to relate.
