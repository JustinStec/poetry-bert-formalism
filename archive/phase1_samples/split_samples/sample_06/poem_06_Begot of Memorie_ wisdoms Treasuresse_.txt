To your diuining tongue is giuen a power
Of vttering secrets large and limitlesse:
You can Penelopes strange thoughts expresse
Which she conceiu'd, & the[n] would faine haue told,
VVhen shee the wondrous Christall did behold.

124
Her winged thoughts bore vp her minde so hie
As that shee weend shee saw the glorious throne
VVhere the bright moone doth sit in maiestie,
A thousand sparkling starres about her shone,
But she herselfe did sparkle more alone
Then all those thousand beauties would haue done
If they had been confounded all in one.

125
And yet she thought those starrs mou'd in such measure
To doe their Soueraigne honor & delight,
As sooth'd her minde wt sweet enchaunting [pleasure]
Although the various change amaz'd her sight,
And her weake iudgement dyd entangle quite:
Beside, theyr mouing made the[m] shine more cleere,
As Diamonds mou'd, more sparkling do appeare.

126
Thys was the Picture of her wondrous thought;
But who can wonder that her thought was so,
Sith Vulcan King of fire, that Mirrour wrought
(Which things to come, present, & past doth know)
And there did represent in liuely show;
