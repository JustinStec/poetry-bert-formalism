Ancestors’ wildest dreams

r drunk on the sticky floor
of a Denny’s        texting gma Ayóó anííníshní;
& crying in the same hot breath abt
not knowing the right word for apology

if one exists         keyboard smashing
resilience resilience reslienceResielance
as we delete IG so we don’t
have to see ppl out-sacred-ing

each other    Maybe we’re only sovereign
in bed         sometimes    drowning
in the dark and in the soft pools
of their eyes, living off the hard tack

of their thighs moving to an MCR mixtape
We froth            Ancestors’ sleep-paralysis
demon     caught in cold sweat and skipped
therapy              untangling our bodies

from sheets       always untangling
hair out from under        somewhere
Fractals left in corners, under juniper
berry branches       Do we even remember

how gma baked her pies?

The cornstalks
stretched higher than Holy People
that yr .
