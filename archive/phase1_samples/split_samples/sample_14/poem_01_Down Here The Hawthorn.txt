Down here the hawthorn.


And a stir of wings,
Spring-lit wings that wake
Sudden tumult in the brake,
Tumult of blossom tide, tumult of foaming mist
Where the bright bird's tumultuous feathers kissed.

White mists are blinding me,
White mist of hedgerow, white mist of wings.

Down here the hawthorn
And a stir of wings.
