[BANJOS]
Every slum had sent its half-a-score
The round world over.

(Booth had groaned for more.

Every banner that the wide world flies
Bloomed with glory and transcendent dyes.

Big-voiced lasses made their banjos bang,
Tranced, fanatical they shrieked and sang:—
“Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?

Hallelujah! It was queer to see
Bull-necked convicts with that land make free.

Loons with trumpets blowed a blare, blare, blare
On, on upward thro’ the golden air!
(Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?
