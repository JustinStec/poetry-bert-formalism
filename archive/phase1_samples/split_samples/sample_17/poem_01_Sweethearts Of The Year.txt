Sweetheart Spring
Our Sweetheart, Spring, came softly,
Her gliding hands were fire,
Her lilac breath upon our cheeks
Consumed us with desire.

By her our God began to build,
Began to sow and till.

He laid foundations in our loves
For every good and ill.

We asked Him not for blessing,
We asked Him not for pain —
Still, to the just and unjust
He sent His fire and rain.
