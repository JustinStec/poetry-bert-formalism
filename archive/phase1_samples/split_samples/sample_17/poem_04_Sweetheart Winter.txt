We had done naught of service
To win our Maker's praise.

Yet Sweetheart Winter came to us
To gild our waning days.

Down Jacob's winding ladder
She came from Sunshine Town,
Bearing the sparkling mornings
And clouds of silver-brown;
Bearing the seeds of Springtime.

Upon her snowy seas
Bearing the fairy star-flowers
For baby Christmas trees.
