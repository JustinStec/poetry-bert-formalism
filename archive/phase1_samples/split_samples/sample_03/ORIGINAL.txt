In ancient Greece, for all her heroes, for Medea    .


water meant death.

— Jesmyn Ward, Salvage the Bones


i poured a bowl of cereal,

threw the empty box in the

trash can.

granddaddy pulled

the box from the trash,

poured the crumbs into a

bowl, then doused the sand

in milk.

he looked down at the

bowl, murmuring about how

he had survived the depression.

told

a story about asking for hot water

at colored diners, how he would

pour ketchup in cups to make soup.

this was how

i first learned i am


wasteful.


i would stand in the bathroom

with my mother.

would ask her

why the water in the bowl was

red.

she would tell me she

had eaten beets.

i suppose

i was too young to learn

the truth, milkflowers

spill petals red.


in my catholic school of fish,

we took a beautifully wrapped box,

passed it around the class,

unwrapping it piece by piece.

afterwards it was cleverly

explained that the box is

a girl’s virginity

the gift we give our husbands.

& who wants a toy that has

already been opened?

half

the joy is in untying the string.

this is how i was taught

that at my very core, i am


ungrateful.


i met someone recently,

in an irish bar, who told me

it’s about knowing what i need.

he said laterwhat you need

is a wife
