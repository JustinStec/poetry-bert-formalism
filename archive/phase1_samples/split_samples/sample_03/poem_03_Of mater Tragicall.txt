Nothyng purueyed at all
Of style Heroycall
But full of speche rurall
And verses rustycall
Unto my maisters all
Besechig the which shall
Here of thy chance fatall
And the in speciall
Which most are doctrynate
With wisdome decorate
In science eleuate
And eche other estate
To be content algate
And nat to conspyrate
Agaynst the any hate
