And the flower-foam stirred
By a Spring-lit bird.

White hawthorn mist is blinding me.

I lower my gaze, and on this old
Brown bridle road
Crusted with golden moss and mould
The hedgerow flings
Lush carpetings,
Blossom woven carpetings light lain
Under the farmer's lumbering load;
And, floating past the spent March wrack,
The footstep trail, the traveller's track.

Down here the hawthorn.
