Samson —
The Judge,
The Nazarite.

The air was black, like the smoke of a dragon.

Samson's heart was as big as a wagon.

He sang like a shining golden fountain.

He sweated up to the top of the mountain.

He threw down the gates with a noise like judgment.

And the quails all ran with the big arousement.

But he wept — "I must not love tough queens,
And spend on them my hard earned means.

I told that girl I would drink no more.

Therefore she drove me from her door.

Oh sorrow!
Sorrow!
I cannot hide.

Oh Lord look down from your chariot side.

You made me Judge, and I am not wise.

I am weak as a sheep for all my size.
