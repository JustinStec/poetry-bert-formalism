Be coming
Into your mind.

Samson saw the sun anew.

He left the gates in the grass and dew.

He went to a county-seat a-nigh.

Found a harlot proud and high:
Philistine that no man could tame —
Delilah was her lady-name.

Oh sorrow,
Sorrow,
She was too wise.

She cut off his hair,
She put out his eyes.
