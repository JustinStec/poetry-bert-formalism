For Bessie in the Garden

To the heart, to the heart the white petals
Quietly fall.

Memory is a little wind, and magical
The dreaming hours.

As a breath they fall, as a sigh;
Green garden hours too langorous to waken,
White leaves of blossomy tree wind-shaken:
As a breath, a sigh,
As the slow white drift
Of a butterfly.

Flower-wings falling, wings of branches
One after one at wind's droop dipping;
Then with the lift
Of the air's soft breath, in sudden avalanches
Slipping.

Quietly, quietly the June wind flings
White wings,
White petals, past the footpath flowers
Adown my dreaming hours.

At the heart, at the heart the butterfly settles.

As a breath, a sigh
Fall the petals of hours, of the white-leafed flowers,
Fall the petalled wings of the butterfly.

To my heart, to my heart the white petals
Quietly fall.

To the years, other years, old and wistful
Drifts my dream.

Petal-patined the dream, white-mistful
As the dew-sweet haunt of the dim whitebeam
Because of memory, a little wind .
