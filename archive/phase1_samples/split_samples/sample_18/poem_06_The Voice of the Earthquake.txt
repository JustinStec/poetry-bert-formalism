Is gold, gold, gold.

Their brittle speech and their clutching reach
Is gold, gold, gold.

What is the fire-engine s ding dong bell?

The burden of the burble of the bull-frog in the well?

Gold, gold, gold.

What is the color of the cup and plate
And knife and fork of the chief of state?

What is the savor of the salt sea air?

Gold, gold, gold.

What is the color of the sea-girl s hair?

Gold, gold, gold.

What color are the cradle and the bridal bed?

What color are the coffins of the great grey dead?

Gold, gold, gold.

What is the hue of the big whales hide?

Gold, gold, gold.

Gold, gold, gold.

" What is the color of the pumpkins in the moonlight?

Gold, gold, gold.

The color of the moth and the worm in the starlight?

Gold, gold, gold.
