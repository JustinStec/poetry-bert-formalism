Part I.

A Short Walk Along the Coast
Yes, I have walked in California,
And the rivers there are blue and white.

Thunderclouds of grapes hang on the mountains.

Bears in the meadows pitch and fight.

(Limber, double- jointed lords of fate,
Proud native sons of the Golden Gate.

And flowers burst like bombs in California,
Exploding on tomb and tower.

And the panther-cats chase the red rabbits,
Scatter their young blood every hour.

And the cattle on the hills of California
And the very swine in the holes
Have ears of silk and velvet
And tusks like long white poles.

And the very swine, big hearted,
Walk with pride to their doom
For they feed on the sacred raisins
Where the great black agates loom.

Goshawfuls are Burbanked with the grizzly bears.

At midnight their children come clanking up the stairs.

They wriggle up the canyons,
Nose into the caves,
And swallow the papooses and the Indian braves.

The trees climb so high the crows are dizzy
Flying to their nests at the top.

While the jazz-birds screech, and storm the brazen beach
And the sea-stars turn flip flop.

The solid Golden Gate soars up to Heaven.

Perfumed cataracts are hurled
From the zones of silver snow
To the ripening rye below,
To the land of the lemon and the nut
And the biggest ocean in the world.

While the Native Sons, like lords tremendous
Lift up their heads with chants sublime,
And the band-stands sound the trombone, the saxophone and xylophone
And the whales roar in perfect tune and time.

And the chanting of the whales of California
I have set my heart upon.

It is sometimes a play by Belasco,
Sometimes a tale of Prester John.

Part II.
