The Haughty Snail-King

Twelve snails went walking after night.

They'd creep an inch or so,
Then stop and bug their eyes
And blow.

Some folks .


are .


deadly .


slow.

Twelve snails went walking yestereve,
Led by their fat old king.

They were so dull their princeling had
No sceptre, robe or ring—
Only a paper cap to wear
When nightly journeying.

This king-snail said: "I feel a thought
Within.


It blossoms soon.


O little courtiers of mine, .


I crave a pretty boo.


Oh, yes .


(High thoughts with effort come
And well-bred snails are ALMOST dumb.

"I wish I had a yellow crown
As glistering .


as .


the moon.
