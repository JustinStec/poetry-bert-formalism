By great remorse of hert & inwarde repentaunce
Toke [illeg.

To R{ome st}reight he cae for to receyue penaunce
And as the pope wolde to byde his ordynaunce
As he shulde hym enioyne & Iesu Christ besought
His syns to forgyue wherin he had mis wrought.

The comon brute was soone thorowe Rome
How that kyng Alba shulde come on pilgrim
By Harbigem the which came hym beforne
Wherfore the Senatour as there was the vsage
ine hym richely rode with all his hole lynage
As well to manyfest his hye magnifycence
As to the kyng to do pleasure and reuerence.

Most amyable chere this noble Senatour
Made to kyng Alba and he to hym also
Eche vnto other dyd synguler honour
And so it befell that on a day or two
Whan that this Senatour to kyng Alba dyd go
To the triumphe and feest the trouthe to verify
Custance sonne he toke with hym in company.

Perchauce soe wolde suppose by cosent of Custace
That this senatour her sonne dyde leade to fest
To you I can nat expresse the circumstance
But be it as be may there was he at the fest
But certesse sothe it is right at his mothers hest
Before kyng Alba all the dyner space
The childe stode lokyng aye in the kynges face.

This childe to beholde the kyng had great woder
And of the senatour demaunded he anone
Sayeng: whose fayre childe is he y standes yoder
I can nat tell quod he by god and by saynt Iohan
A mother he hath but father knowe I none
That I dyd euer se and shortly in that stounde
He tolde how the mother & eke y childe were foude
certesse sir quod she vnto the trouthe to go
{As} good a lyuer as she: in all my life
I haue nat knowen nor fewe suche other mo
Of worldly women widowe mayde nor wife
Moche leauer she had to dye vpon a knife
Than sensualite her reason shulde subdue
In her all vice is deed and vertue floureth newe.

This childe of fauour resembled moche Custance
As lyke as possible a creature might be
Kyng Alba the face had in his remembraunce
Of noble Custaunce and theron mused he
Coniecting wheder the childes mother were she
Whiche was his spouse and wife & priuely he sight
And from the table he spedde in all he might.

Certesse quod the kyng I haue a dissye heed
Full well ought I [illeg.

] me after rightfull iugement
That long or now my wife in the salte see is deed
And after a while he tourned his argument
Sayeng: why may nat Christ whiche is oīpotent
Kepe her nowe from dethe as he hath done before
For whom he lyst to saue shall neuer be forlore.

It is as possible that she be hider brought
Preserued fro harme of stormes tempestious
Sithe he is most of power that made all of nought
As wele as she before on see most peryllous
Was to our countre safe conueyed vnto vs
What god wyll haue done who may the same resist
He is the lorde of all he may do what he lyst.

Howe kynge Alba had knowledge of his faithfull spouse Custaunce and of their ioyouse metyng.

Nat long tyme after home with the senatour
Went Alba on a day to se this wonders chaunce
The senatour made to Alba great honour
And hastely he sent after the fayre Custaunce:
Well ye may suppose she lyst nothing to daunce
Whan she the cause therof did knowe & vnderstode
Her blode was altred to here th ne sonde.

I you and pray
one worde of me ye say.

me wolde say the childe Maurice
e did relate vnto the Em&perour
I gesse was nat so folysshe nice
To hym that is the chefe and heed of all honour
Aboue all erthely princes the fragrant flour
Wolde sende forthe any childe but best it is to deme
That he hym selfe went and so it might be seme.

Theperour at the fyrstdid graunt most louingly
To come to dyneras Alba hym besought
But fermely he behelde and loked busely
Upon the childe Maurice & on his dougter thought
Home went kyng Alba and duely as he ought
Prepared for the feest of all that might suffyce
By wisdome ordred as he coude well deuyse.

The daye appoynted cae that Alba gan hym dresse
And eke his wife Custance the Emperour to mete
And right well besene they ousnesse
But whan Custance sawe her father in the strete
Adowne she lighted and kneled at his fete
My father dere quod; she your yog {doughter Custace}
Is raced nowe full clene out ofance.

Your doughter Custance quod; she
Whiche long a go ye sent farre {forthe} vnto Surrye
She am I father whiche that in the salte see
All alone was put and dampned for to dye
Dere father nowe she said I pray you hertely
Sende me no more forthe so farre in Hethannesse
But thaake here my lorde of all his great kyndnesse.

The parfite inwarde ioye none can declare it all
Bitwene the thre made sithe they this wyse be met
But of this mater an ende nowe make I shall
The tyme fast passeth and long processe dothe let
These gladsome people were vnto dyner set
And thus in ioye and blysse at mete I let the dwell
A thousande tymes better than any tong can tell.

Mauricius this childe was after Emperour
Confirmed by the pope and lyued vertuously
Alway to holy churche he maynteyned honour
But all these stories I leaue and passe forthe by
At fyrst of Custaunce to speke purposed I
Mauricius lyfe I beare nat well in mynde
In olde romayne iestes his actes may ye fynde.

Howe kynge Alba departed from Rome with his wife Custance came home in to Englande: & howe after the deth {of} the kyng her husbande she {retur}ned vnto Rome agayne where as she her dayes/amonge her pay- frendes with great quietnesse.

Cap.

Whan Alba sawe his tyme wouten more delay
His leaue of the Emperour he toke for to departe
And with his wife Custace he cae the gaynest way
Streight vnto Englade where they wease of hert
In quietnesse lyued but what wight may after
The course of fortune for welth wyll nat abyde
Tyme chaungeth as the mone mutable lyke ytyde
What creature lyueth in suche delyte a day
That is nat moued outher in conscience
With yre maltalent or some maner of fray
Enuyousnesse or pride or some concupiscence
All this I pronounce as touchyng my sentence
That small tyme lasted in ioye or with plesaunce
The lyfe of Alba with his true wyfe Custaunce.

For dethe wyll nat forgyue to hye ne lowe his rent
But after a yere or two was gone expresse
Kyng Alba from this lyfe discessed died and went
For whom Custance made great mone & heuynesse
To god she prayed his soule from payne release
And soone after that he was deed and layde in clay
Custance towarde Rome her dressed on the way.

Custaunce aryued at Rome that riche cyte
Wher as her frendes; were on lyue both hole & soude
Nowe hath she escaped all harde aduersite
And whan she her father the Emperour had foude
Upon bothe her knees she fell vnto the grounde
Wepyng in hert for ioye and with a corage bolde
Our lorde she thanked an hudred thousande folde.

Of all her trouble her sorowe care and drede
Whiche in her most peryle fro dethe dyd her defēde
And with her frendes there in quietnesse dyd lede
The rest of her lyfe and neuer dyd entende
Tyll dethe to disceuer and thus I make an ende
Of Custauce storie beseching Christ that he
Bring the vnto his blysse which shall it rede or se.
