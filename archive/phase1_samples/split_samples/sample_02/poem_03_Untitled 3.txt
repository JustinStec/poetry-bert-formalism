The keyboard’s toothy smile splayed wide,

the flatlined cursor blinks impatiently on the

screen, my fingers struggle to tap into word

processing.

I monitor all of the track changes.

Even the computer is a slave to death.

Its in-

nards already bygone, its body obsolete upon

year of purchase.

I am a librarian, swimming the

digital divide, my predecessor’s paddles —

a mass of floppy disks in an office closet.

They pile up like the teeth of slaves waiting

for sale.

An affluent businessman at the door,

his hands panning the saliva for white gold.

His fingers parting the cavity, pursed lips cooing,I need something of yours to call my own.

The desire

to chew and smile at will.

My grandmother lost

her mind before her teeth, lost the memories be-

fore the enamel gave way to rot.

My face has my

mother’s abacus features.

We are, in fact, diphyo-

dont.

In one lifetime we develop two sets of teeth.

The missing space filled with air, a hollow exile

before the native tongue.

I pray my unborn child

will have a gap.

What the French call “dents du

bonheur” or lucky teeth.

The womb’s peephole is

rather impressionable.

I will fasten the buttons of

time.

I will take the baby’s body in my own,

whisper a plea in its discriminating ear:Try to keep your wits about you, my love.

Memory is about the future, not the past.
