After this homely rate
Thy simple & processe wrate:
& where y dost repayre
Alway behaue the fayre
Be nothyng in dispayre
Thy selfe for to present
Though y be naked sent
Without y freshe garmet
Of termes eloquent
But pondre myne entent
say y right fayne I wolde
Do better if I coulde
Some men of grauite
How symple that thou be
May happen yet parde
To rede and ouer se
Thy rude barreyne store
Why may nat Wise me loke
Upon a folisshe boke
I trust no man of name
Though y be out of frae
In ernest nor in game
By speche wyll nat defae
Nor lay to the no blame
But count it my foly
Whiche so intentifely
In that wherin as I
Can nothing skyll truely
Haue made my selfe busy
For no cause els it was
But vacant tyme to pas
Nat with intencion
Of proude presumpcion
But where as trasgressyon
By way of locucion
Is made without reason
With humble submissyon
Under correction
In the protection
And wyse discrecion
Of eche maner person
Althing is said and don
And who so dothe the se
Pray them to & pardone me.
