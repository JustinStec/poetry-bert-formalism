A tooth is made up of the crown and the root,

all the King’s Men destined to revolt.

There are

many ways to worm your way inside, many open-

ings in the body of an animal.

Some orifices gated

with white entryways.

A wooden portcullis, a pick-

et fence, a laced corset secured tightly by a maid,

a pointed geode just waiting to be pulled, the cavern

wall glittering in the dark.

Sharp crystals ornament

the cave’s jawbone.

Cave canem, quite naturally speak-

ing.

A hooded hole a place for some to hide or go

seek.

A toothless whistle the signal for the slave

hunting bloodhounds, with canines fanged like

water moccasins.

The swamp mud gushing like

the suppertime mush sloshing between the gums

of a Confederate soldier.

The terror of limbs at

odds with the self.

In World War I, trench foot

meant frequent amputations, the blade sliding

like floss between each toe.

Some diseases attack

the foot or mouth, gums left inflamed in the

cross fire.

A grieving mother wears dog tags

around her neck.

Her son’s baby shoes and teeth

cast in bronze.

The pulp at the center is how the

tooth receives nourishment, how it transmits

signals to the brain.

The forgetting makes the

present tense possible.

Memory is the gravity

of the mind.

All the icebergs have started to

melt, milky objects left hanging by a

string, the doorknobs means to an end.
