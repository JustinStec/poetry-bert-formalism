In the midst of tabas of pleasant greenery,
Surrounded by logs—covered with flowers,
The roofs of a proud nation are raised;
There are many of your children, in strong spirits,
Fearsome in war, who in dense cohorts
They haunt the immense expanse of woods.

They are loud, severe, thirsty for glory,
Already prelios incite, already sing victory,
Now the sweet ones respond to the singer's voice:
They are all Timbiras, brave warriors!
Your name flies in people's mouths,
Condon of prodigies, of glory and terror!
The neighboring tribes, without strength, without pride,
The weapons breaking, throwing them into the river,
The incense they aspired from their maracas:
Fearful of the wars that the strong light,
Expensive ignominious tributes they yield there,
To the tough warriors subject to peace.

In the center of the taba extends a yard,
Where now the warrior council gathers
Of the lady tribe, of the servile tribes:
The old men sitting down practiced from the past,
And the restless young men, whom the party enamors,
They spill out around an unhappy Indian.

Who is it?

— no one knows: his name is unknown,
Your tribe does not say: — of a remote people
Descends indeed—from a gentle people;
So there in Greece to the island slave
Made them distinct from the vile Muslim
The correct lines of the noble profile.

By cases of war fell prisoner
In the hands of the Timbiras: — in the extensive terreiro
The ceiling that held him in prison is devastated;
The surrounding tribes are invited,
Careful they take care of the vase of colors,
Of the various accompaniments of the honorable function.

The wood of the vast fire is gathered,
The light embira rope is tightened,
The mace is adorned with gentle feathers:
At cost, among the vacancies of the village people
Walks the Timbira, which the mob surrounds,
Dashing in feathers of various shades.

However, women with leda triganza,
Accustomed to the rite of barbaric usança,
The Indian already wants captive to end:
The coma cuts him, the limbs dye him,
Shining enduape on the body encircle him,
Shades his forehead gentle singing.

II
In deep vases of white clay boil the cauim;
Cups are filled, pleasure begins, feasting reigns.

The prisoner, whose death they long for, sits,
The prisoner, what other setting sun will ever see!
The hard rope, which encircles her lap, shows her the end
From the dark life, which will be shorter than the feast!
Yet the eyes of ignoble weeping are dry;
Mute lips do not descend complaints from the heart.

But a martyrdom, which cannot be covered up, makes wrinkles
The lying placidity of the face on the bold forehead!
What do you have, warrior?

What fear assails you in the horrendous step?

Honor of the tabas that born saw you, day off dying.

Slack dying; because beyond the Andes revives the fort,
Who knew how to proudly contrast the fears of cold death.

Creeping grass, exposed to the sun, to the rain, there withers and hangs:
Only to the trunk, which devastates the air, does lightning offend!
What is it?

Tupã ordered him to fall, as he lived;
And the hunter who saw him prostrated fainted!
What are you afraid of, O warrior?

Beyond the Andes revives the fort,
Who knew how to proudly contrast the fears of cold death.

III
In a wide circle of new warriors
Ledo walks the Timbira festival,
To whom the sacrifice belongs the honors.

On the forehead the canitar shakes in waves,
The enduape on the strap sways,
In the right hand I weigh the ivirapeme,
Proud and vigorous.

— at the smallest step
Ivory target necklace, badge of honor,
That adorns her neck and chest, roars and trembles,
As if by an unknown spell
Enchanted there the great souls
Of the vanquished Tapuias, still cry
Being glory and coat of arms of fierce enemies.

“Here I am, says the prisoner Indian;
“Since I am weak, and without tribe, and without family,
“Our forests you dared devastated,
“You will die a vile death at the hand of a strong one.

The miserable opposite comes to terreiro;
From the lap to the belt the muçurana descends:
“Tell us who you are, sing your deeds,
“Or if it pleases you more, defend yourself.

” Begins
The Indian, who pours out his eyes around,
With sad voice that the mood moves.

IV
My death song,
Warriors, hear:
I am a child of the wilds,
In the wilds I grew up;
warriors coming down
From the Tupi tribe.

Of the puissant tribe,
who is wandering now
By fickle fate,
Warriors, I was born;
I'm brave, I'm strong,
I am a son of the North;
My death song,
Warriors, I heard.

I've seen raw fights,
From enemy tribes,
And the hard fatigues
I tasted of war;
in mendacious waves
I felt for the faces
the fleeting hisses
Of the winds I loved.

I walked far lands,
I fought cruel wars,
I wandered through the mountains
Of the vile Aimorés;
I saw brave fights,
I saw forts—slaves!
of gnawing strangers
Footwear.

And the ploughed fields,
And the broken bows,
And the poor piagas
No longer maracas;
And the sweet singers,
Serving the lords,
That traitors came,
With signs of peace
To the blows of the enemy
My last friend,
homeless, homeless
Fell next to me!
With placid face,
Serene and composed,
the bitter disgust
With me I suffered.

My father by my side
Already blind and broken,
grated feathers,
Signed in me:
We both, petty,
By wayward paths,
covered with thorns
We got here!
The old however
suffering already so much
Of hunger and brokenness,
I just wanted to die!
I hold back no more,
I wander into the woods,
Of the arrows I have
I want to be worth it.

So, outsider,
I fell prisoner
From a warrior section
How I found myself:
the raw restlessness
Of the weak and blind father,
