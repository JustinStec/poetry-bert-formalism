Whatever — say it!
I was your guide
In the dark night,
the only joy
What God has left you
He leaned on me,
In me it was signed,
Rested in me,
What a son I am to you.

To the poor old man
grated feathers,
Already blind and broken,
What's left?

- To die.

while describing
The turn so short
Of the life you had,
Let me live!
Not vile, not ignite,
But strong, but brave,
I will be your slave:
Here I will come.

Warriors, not chorus
From the tears that I cry;
If I deplore life,
I also know how to die.

V
Release him! says the boss.

Astonishes the mob;
The warriors murmur: barely heard,
Nor can a chief ever give such an order!
Shouts a second time with a louder voice,
Prisons are loosened, the embira gives way,
At cost, yes; but gives in: the stranger is saved,
— Timbira, says the tender Indian,
Released only from the knots that held him:
You are an illustrious warrior, a great leader,
You who were so moved by my evil,
Nor do you suffer that, transposing nature,
With eyes where the light no longer flickers,
The tired father mourns the death of the son,
That only by his in the voice he knows.

— You are free; part.

"And I will.

— In vain.

— Yes, I will return, my father dead.

"Don't come back!"
It's very happy, if it exists, in which you don't see it,
What son has, what cries: you are free; part!
"Do you think I'm chickening out,
How afraid I am to die!
— You are free; part!
— Well, I won't go; I want to prove to you
That a son of the Tupi lives with honor,
And with greater honor, if by chance they win,
From death the glorious step affront.

— You lied, that a Tupi never cries,
And you cried!… part; We do not want
With vile flesh weaken the strong.

The Tupi survived: - heaving in waves
The beating of the heart was heard
Rush.

- Of the flushed face
Cold beads of sweat ran:
Perhaps a thought assailed him.
