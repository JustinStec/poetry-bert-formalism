No voice directs me!…
Do you think you are offended?

You gave me love, and life
What would you give me — I know well;
But remember those wild ones
Hearts, that got in
Between us; and if they won,
Little do you know how much I fought!
VII
Oh! if I fought!… but I should
Expose yourself in a public square,
As a target to the populace,
A target for your dictionaries!
I should have, I could
Such a sacrifice accept thee
To pay you at the end,
My days joining yours?

VIII
Indeed, yes; but I thought,
that you would forget me,
That, without me, happy days
They were waiting for you; and in favor
Of my prayers, I told
That the good God would accept me
my fair share of joy
For yours, share of pain!
IX
That I was wrong, now I see it;
Your eyes swim in tears,
Your chest heaves, and yet
You can't even face me;
It was a mistake, but it wasn't a crime,
I didn't forget you, I swear to you:
I sacrificed my future,
Life and glory for loving you!
X
All all; and in misery
Of prolonged martyrdom,
Slow, cruel, disguised,
That I didn't even trust you;
“She is happy (she told me)
“Your rest is my work.

My petty luck denied me.
