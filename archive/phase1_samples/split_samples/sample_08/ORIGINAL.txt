The Snake Of Life

Repulsive phantoms beset me,
Clawing my heart.

The little man huddled inside me
Begins to smart.

Midnight.

I'm still awake.


Luminal's no good.

Take Nembutal, Noxiron .


or just
Take over .


try on your left side lying,
You must get to sleep.


You must.


You need sound sleep.


For the coming day,
So you'll feel full of enterprise.

So you'll be – look, the east
Is already aglow
And I haven't yet closed my eyes.

If I take a few drops
From the vial
At the back of the drawer
Right here,
The nightmare of this night
May swiftly drop away.


Simply disappear.

My hand reaching out already
To sever the knot with a knife,
Freezes,
Quakes.


In my blood is embedded
Too deeply
The snake of life!.
