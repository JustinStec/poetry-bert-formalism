Willing in the Orisha

i.

i.

My body a full echo                I dawdle down to the creek


Ask the god of blood for
Abundance     continuity


My offering      the syrup of pressed beans   &
A 7-winged tulip

Later the rains swell the creek with coffee            the storm        a beckoned sheet
The immortal herself reaping the earth          the tongues cut out of the cows

I walk in                       as the wash      attempts its valiant swallow
A cafeteria aid             wipes the cotton from the counter


Her bald eyes              aurora with       seeds


You brought that           didn’t you?

iv.

iv.

My bottom lip a pink venom     My desire a valley with
legs       His steady fingers toying the tea            I look
up to a straight line and bury it    Can’t downsize what
hithers me




Every now & then a troubled thirst
opens my mouth for a song that does not come
I feel it all
until a fixed voice decides




No      but wait      you’re the water
