And there the broad Pendragon flag
In deathless splendor flies.

"Nay, minstrel, but the great ships come
From out the sunset sea.

We cannot greet the souls they bring
With welcome high and free.

How can the Nippon nondescripts
That weird and dreadful band
Be aught but what we find them here:—
The blasters of the land?

"First race, first men from anywhere
To face you, eye to eye.

For that do you curse Avalon
And raise a hue and cry?

These toilers cannot kiss your hand,
Or fawn with hearts bowed down:
Be glad for them, and Avalon,
And Arthur's ghostly crown.

"No doubt your guests, with sage debate
In grave things gentlemen
Will let your trade and farms alone
And turn them back again.

But why should brawling braggarts rise
With hasty words of shame
To drive them back like dogs and swine
Who in due honor came?

"We cannot give them honor, sir.

We give them scorn for scorn.

And Rumor steals around the world
All white-skinned men to warn
Against this sleek silk-merchant here
And viler coolie-man
And wrath within the courts of war
Brews on against Japan!"
"Must Avalon, with hope forlorn,
Her back against the wall,
Have lived her brilliant life in vain
While ruder tribes take all?
