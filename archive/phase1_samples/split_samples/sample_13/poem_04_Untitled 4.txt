with lean rat Platt.

Where is Roosevelt, the young dude cowboy,
Who hated Bryan, then aped his way?

Gone to join the shadows with might Cromwell
And tall King Saul, till the Judgement day.

Where is Altgeld, brave as the truth,
Whose name the few still say with tears?

Gone to join the ironies with Old John Brown,
Whose fame rings loud for a thousand years.

Where is that boy, that Heaven-born Bryan,
That Homer Bryan, who sang from the West?

Gone to join the shadows with Altgeld the Eagle,
Where the kings and the slaves and the troubadours rest.
