Where is McKinley, Mark Hanna's McKinley,
His slave, his echo, his suit of clothes?

Gone to join the shadows, with the pomps of that time,
And the flames of that summer's prairie rose.

Where is Cleveland whom the Democratic platform
Read from the party in a glorious hour?

Gone to join the shadows with pitchfork Tillman,
And sledge-hammer Altgeld who wrecked his power.

Where is Hanna, bulldog Hanna,
Low-browed Hanna, who said: Stand pat'?

Gone to his place with old Pierpont Morgan.

Gone somewhere.
