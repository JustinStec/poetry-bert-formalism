When after your bath, with wet hair spread on your shoulders, you walked through the shadow of the champa tree to the little court where you say your prayers, you would notice the scent of the flower, but not know that it came from me.

In one salutation to thee, my God, let all my senses spread out and touch this world at thy feet.
