Abstract
Analyzing poetry with automatic tools has great potential for improving verse-related research. Over the last few decades, this field
has expanded notably and a large number of tools aiming at analyzing various aspects of poetry have been developed. However, the
concrete connection between these tools and traditional scholars investigating poetry and metrics is often missing. The purpose of
this article is to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive survey of the automatic poetry analysis tools available for European lan­
guages. The tools are described and classified according to the language for which they are primarily developed, and to their function­
alities and purpose. Particular attention is given to those that have open-source code or provide an online version with the same func­
tionality. Combining more traditional research with these tools has clear advantages: it provides the opportunity to address theoretical
questions with the support of large amounts of data; also, it allows for the development of new and diversified approaches.
Keywords: Poetry analysis; Natural Language Processing; Computational Literary Studies.
