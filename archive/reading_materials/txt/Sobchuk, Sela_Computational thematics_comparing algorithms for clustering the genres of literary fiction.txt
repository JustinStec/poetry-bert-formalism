                  learning of thematic similarities between texts, which we call “computational thematics”.
                  These algorithms belong to three steps of analysis: text pre-processing, extraction of text
                  features, and measuring distances between the lists of features. Each of these steps includes
                  a variety of options. We test all the possible combinations of these options. Every combi-
                  nation of algorithms is given a task to cluster a corpus of books belonging to four pre-tagged
                  genres of ﬁction. This clustering is then validated against the “ground truth” genre labels.
                  Such comparison of algorithms allows us to learn the best and the worst combinations for
                  computational thematic analysis. To illustrate the difference between the best and the worst
                  methods, we then cluster 5000 random novels from the HathiTrust corpus of ﬁction.
