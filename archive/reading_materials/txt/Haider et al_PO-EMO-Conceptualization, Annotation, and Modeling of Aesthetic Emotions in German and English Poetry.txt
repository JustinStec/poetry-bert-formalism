Most approaches to emotion analysis of social media, literature, news, and other domains focus exclusively on basic emotion categories as
defined by Ekman or Plutchik. However, art (such as literature) enables engagement in a broader range of more complex and subtle emo-
tions. These have been shown to also include mixed emotional responses. We consider emotions in poetry as they are elicited in the reader,
rather than what is expressed in the text or intended by the author. Thus, we conceptualize a set of aesthetic emotions that are predictive of
aesthetic appreciation in the reader, and allow the annotation of multiple labels per line to capture mixed emotions within their context. We
evaluate this novel setting in an annotation experiment both with carefully trained experts and via crowdsourcing. Our annotation with
experts leads to an acceptable agreement of κ = .70, resulting in a consistent dataset for future large scale analysis. Finally, we conduct
first emotion classification experiments based on BERT, showing that identifying aesthetic emotions is challenging in our data, with up
to .52 F1-micro on the German subset. Data and resources are available at https://github.com/tnhaider/poetry-emotion.

Table 5: Results obtained via boostrapping for annotation aggregation. The row Threshold shows how many people within a
group of five annotators should agree on a particular emotion. The column labeled Counts shows the average number of
times certain emotion was assigned to a stanza given the threshold. Cells with ‘–’ mean that neither of two groups satisfied
the threshold.


Crowds especially disagree on many more intricate emotion
labels (Uneasiness, Vitality/Energy, Nostalgia, Suspense).
We visualize how often two emotions are used to label an
instance in a confusion table in Figure 2. Sadness is used
most often to annotate a stanza, and it is often confused with
Suspense, Uneasiness, and Nostalgia. Further, Beauty/Joy
partially overlaps with Awe/Sublime, Nostalgia, and Sad-
ness.
On average, each crowd annotator uses two emotion labels
per stanza (56% of cases); only in 36% of the cases the an-
notators use one label, and in 6% and 1% of the cases three
and four labels, respectively. This contrasts with the expert
annotators, who use one label in about 70% of the cases and
two labels in 30% of the cases for the same 59 four-liners.
Concerning frequency distribution for emotion labels, both
